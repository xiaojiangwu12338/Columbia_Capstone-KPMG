**Columbia University x KPMG**  
*Intelligent Document Analysis for Healthcare Programs Using LLMs and RAG*

---

### 🎯 Project Overview
Government healthcare programs, such as New York State Medicaid, involve complex eligibility criteria 
spread across multiple interrelated policy documents.  
Our project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** 
to simplify policy navigation and question answering.

Users can ask questions such as:
> “When did redetermination begin for the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency unwind in New York State?”

and receive grounded, cited answers from authoritative Medicaid documents.
