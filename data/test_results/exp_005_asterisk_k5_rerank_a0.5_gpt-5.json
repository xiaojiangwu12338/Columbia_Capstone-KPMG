For additional information regarding the COVID-19 PHE,\nproviders can refer to the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nAdministration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) \"Declarations of a Public Health\nEmergency\" web page, located at: https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/default.aspx. For additional\ninformation regarding resumed eligibility reviews, providers can refer to the NY State of Health Important\nChanges to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential Plan web page, located at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nThere are approximately 8 million New Yorkers enrolled in Medicaid, CH and EP who will need to\nrenew their health insurance. It is imperative that members/enrollees are made aware of these\nchanges as they may risk losing their coverage if appropriate actions to renew are not made.\nBeginning in Spring 2023, renewal notices will be sent to members/enrollees based on their enrollment end\ndates. Renewal notices will include the deadline to take action to renew their insurance or risk having a gap\nin coverage. Deadlines will be based on the member/enrollee enrollment end dates and will range from June\n30, 2023, through May 31, 2024. During this time, NY State of Health, the Official Health Plan Marketplace\n(Marketplace), will keep enrollment open to allow consumers who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or\nEP to stay covered by enrolling in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP).\nContinued on Page 3",

Since inception of the PTPE process, the eMedNY “COVID\nFAQs” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/COVID19/FAQ/, has stated: “Within six months of the\nfederal public health emergency being lifted, New York State will cease payments to providers who are\ntemporarily enrolled unless a provider has submitted an application that meets all requirements for New York\nState Medicaid participation, and the application was reviewed and approved by the New York State\nDepartment of Health within six months of the federal public health emergency being lifted.”\nProviders who temporarily enrolled via the PTPE process must complete the full enrollment process by\nNovember 11, 2023, to continue participation in the program. Temporarily enrolled providers will be terminated\nand their NYS Medicaid payments will cease if they do not complete the enrollment process by November\n11, 2023. It can take up to 120 days to complete processing of an application; therefore, it is suggested that\napplications be submitted with enough time to ensure that they are processed by the November 11,\n2023 deadline.\nTo complete an application for full enrollment, providers should visit the eMedNY “Provider Enrollment &\nMaintenance” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/index.aspx. From\nthere, providers can navigate to the enrollment pages for their provider type where they will find instructions\nand a list of documents that must be submitted as part of a complete application.\nQuestions\nQuestions regarding the temporary-to-full enrollment process should be directed to providerenrollment\n@health.ny.gov.",

Since inception of the PTPE process, the eMedNY “COVID\nFAQs” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/COVID19/FAQ/, has stated: “Within six months of the\nfederal public health emergency being lifted, New York State will cease payments to providers who are\ntemporarily enrolled unless a provider has submitted an application that meets all requirements for New York\nState Medicaid participation, and the application was reviewed and approved by the New York State\nDepartment of Health within six months of the federal public health emergency being lifted.”\nProviders who temporarily enrolled via the PTPE process must complete the full enrollment process by\nNovember 11, 2023, to continue participation in the program. Temporarily enrolled providers will be terminated\nand their NYS Medicaid payments will cease if they do not complete the enrollment process by November\n11, 2023. It can take up to 120 days to complete processing of an application; therefore, it is suggested that\napplications be submitted with enough time to ensure that they are processed by the November 11,\n2023 deadline.\nTo complete an application for full enrollment, providers should visit the eMedNY “Provider Enrollment &\nMaintenance” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/index.aspx. From\nthere, providers can navigate to the enrollment pages for their provider type where they will find instructions\nand a list of documents that must be submitted as part of a complete application.\nQuestions\nQuestions regarding the temporary-to-full enrollment process should be directed to providerenrollment\n@health.ny.gov.",

Throughout the COVID-19 PHE, NYS Medicaid\nproviders shifted traditional in person care to remote delivery, where possible. Although some barriers still\nexist and not all services are appropriate for remote delivery, telehealth has been largely beneficial in many\nservice areas. Remote services help address workforce shortages, access to specialists, infection control,\ntransportation issues, and dependent care challenges. In recognition of the changing landscape of healthcare\ndelivery and in preparation for the COVID-19 PHE unwind, the NYS Department of Health (DOH) sought\nfeedback from providers and NYS Medicaid members on their experience with telehealth to inform our post\nPHE policy.\nTo support the use of telehealth services, the NYS Medicaid program will continue to cover services delivered\nvia audio-visual telehealth, when appropriate, if such member chooses to receive telehealth services in lieu\nof an in-person visit.

FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb.

FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4.

MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3.

APGs\nare classified and reimbursed using software developed and published by 3M Health Information Systems\n(3M). FQHCs/RHCS that choose to be reimbursed via the APG reimbursement methodology cannot be\nnegatively impacted in their NYS Medicaid reimbursement due to opting into the alternative rate-setting\nmethodology. If a facility’s NYS Medicaid reimbursement under APGs is lower than what their payment would\nhave been under the all-inclusive PPS rate, the facility is entitled to receive a supplemental payment reflecting\nthe difference between the amount paid to them under APGs and what they would have been paid using the\nall-inclusive PPS rate. Providers should refer to the NYS Department of Health (DOH) “Federally Qualified\nHealth Center (FQHC)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/rates/fqhc/, for\nadditional information relative to the alternative rate-setting methodology.\nFQHCs/RHCs that opt to receive payment via the APG reimbursement methodology should refer to the NYS\nDOH “Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/\nmedicaid/rates/apg/, for additional information pertaining to rates, 3M Versions of the Definition Manual and\nCrosswalk, reimbursement components, regulations, policies, and APG weights.\nMedicaid Managed Care\nUnder federal law, NYS is required to make supplemental payments to FQHCs/RHCs pursuant to a contract\nbetween the FQHCs/RHCs and a Managed Care Organization (MCO) and/or Independent Practice\nAssociation (IPA) for the amount, if any, the FQHCs/RHCs FFS NYS Medicaid rate exceeds the amount of\npayment provided under the Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) contract for the services rendered by the\nFQHC/RHC. These supplemental payments are made directly from NYS to FQHCs and RHCs via FFS claim\nsubmission, using rate code “1609”.\nEffective January 1, 2022, FQHCs and RHCs should no longer report any commercial insurance payments\non their NYS Medicaid FFS supplemental claim submissions. This change will ensure that FQHCs and RHCs\nreceive the complete supplemental payment. NYS Medicaid timely filing limits do apply and are enforceable\nfor all supplemental claims submitted via rate code “1609”.\nMarch 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nProviders should refer to the NYS Managed Care Supplemental Payment Program for FQHCs Policy\nDocument, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/rates/fqhc/fqhc_policy_document\n.htm, and the Update to Fee-for-Service Reimbursement for Federally Qualified Health Center Claims After\nThird-Party Payers and Managed Care Visit and Revenue Reporting Requirements article published in the\nJanuary 2022 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/program/update/2022/docs/mu_no1_jan22_pr.pdf, for additional information pertaining to the NYS\nMedicaid FFS supplemental rate calculation and payment policy.\nAdditionally, NYS Medicaid FFS is also required to make payments to FQHCs/RHCs for visits made by a\nMMC enrollee that are unpaid by the plan or not covered by a contract between the FQHC/RHC and MCO/IPA.\nIn these situations, the State will reimburse FQHCs/RHCs the full FQHC/RHC rate.

New York State routinely completes surveillance activities to evaluate compliance with the following\nappointment availability standards, (Medicaid Model Contract 15.2, Appointment Availability Standards):\n• For urgent care: within twenty-four (24) hours of request.\n• Non-urgent “sick” visit: within forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated.\n• Routine non-urgent, preventive appointments except as otherwise provided in this Section: within four\n(4) weeks of request.\n• Initial prenatal visit: within three (3) weeks during first trimester, within two (2) weeks during the second\ntrimester and within one (1) week during the third trimester.\n• Adult baseline and routine physicals: within twelve (12) weeks from enrollment.\n• Well child care: within four (4) weeks of a request;\n• Initial family planning visits: within two (2) weeks of request.\n• Members must reach a live voice when calling a provider after-hours (i.e., an answering service).\nMMC Plans must require contracted PCPs and OB/GYNs to have the primary responsibility serving as the after-\nhours “on-call” telephone resource to members with medical problems. Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

        "text": "December 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nAttention Ambulance Services:\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nEmergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3) Model\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has invited twenty-five (25) New York State (NYS)\nambulance suppliers and providers to participate in its Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3)\nModel. Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model. Ambulance\nproviders or suppliers that have not been approved by CMS are ineligible for participation in\nNYS Medicaid ET3 Model.\n• A copy of the submitted CMS ET3 Model application and all supporting documents.\n• An affirmation, signed by the chief executive officer of the organization, agreeing to provide the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) with copies of all quality improvement and other reports required by\nCMS.\n• Evidence of outreach to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in the region to coordinate\nnetwork and payment issues for both treat in place (including telehealth) and alternative\ndestinations.\nAll applications and any questions on the Medicaid component of the ET3 Model may be submitted\nelectronically to medtrans@health.ny.gov.",

Treatment in place\nmust be provided by a licensed healthcare practitioner [physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician\nassistant (PA)], either in person or via telehealth. Non-hospital alternative destinations include Community\nMental Health Centers (CMHCs), substance use disorder treatment centers, Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHCs), physician’s offices, and urgent care facilities. For more information about the ET3 Model\nin NYS Medicaid, providers can refer to the article titled The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport\nModel with the Department of Health Parallel Model, published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu\n_no13_nov21_pr.pdf.\nNYS Department of Health (DOH) is pleased to announce that on February 16, 2022, NYS Medicaid\npaid its first ET3 ambulance claim for treatment in place. This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.",

As a result, and to expedite and simplify the enrollment\nprocess, the Department of Health’s Bureau of Provider Enrollment has taken action to implement\nthe following:\n(i) Create an online Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application process that\nallows physicians, registered physician assistants (RPAs), nurse practitioners (NPs),\nregistered nurses (RNs), and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to enroll on a temporary basis\nfor the purpose of assisting with COVID-19 activities;\n(ii) Allow a retroactive effective date no earlier than March 1, 2020, for Provisional Temporary\nProvider Enrollments;\n(iii) Waive application fees for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment applications;\n(iv) Waive the screening requirements of site visits and fingerprint-based Criminal Background\nChecks for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollments;\n(v) Allow providers who are enrolled in either Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program to\nenroll in NY Medicaid as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vi) Allow providers who are licensed outside of New York State to render services to Medicaid\nmembers during the public health emergency as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vii) Allow credentialing offices to submit multiple provider enrollments using a spreadsheet,\nprovided by eMedNY; and\n(viii) Enroll providers who are not enrolled in Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program if the\nrequested data is provided on the Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application and\nthe provider: 1) is not currently excluded from NYS Medicaid; 2) does not appear on the Office\nof Inspector General (OIG) Exclusions Database; and 3) is licensed and legally authorized to\npractice or deliver the service for which they file claims in at least one state or territory.\nContinued on page 3\n\nAndrew M.

At that time, the\nAdvanced Primary Care (APC) Incentive Payment program ended to allow for the NYS implementation and\ntransition into the NYS PCMH model. Additional information regarding NYS PCMH can be found on the NCQA\n“New York State Patient-Centered Medical Home (NYS PCMH) Recognition Program” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/programs/health-care-providers-practices/state-and-government-recognition/nys-\npatient-centered-medical-home/.\nProviders that achieve NYS PCMH recognition are eligible to receive payments provided in the form of either\nper member per month (PMPM) capitation payments for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC), including\nmainstream NYS Medicaid, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-\nSpecial Needs Plans (HIV-SNPs), and Child Health Plus (CHPlus) members; or as a per-visit \"add-on\"\npayment for eligible claims billed for services provided to NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members.\nProviders should refer to Column A in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nNYS PCMH Managed Care Incentive\nRetroactive to April 1, 2024, primary care providers recognized under the NYS PCMH program are entitled to\nan incentive enhancement of $4.00/PMPM for MMC enrollees and CHPlus members under 21 years of age,\nand $2.00/PMPM for individuals 21 years of age and older, in addition to the current $6.00/PMPM payment.\nMMC Plans will be expected to calculate retroactive payments and furnish these payments to NYS PCMH-\nrecognized providers in their networks. In 2025, to receive this enhanced incentive payment (in addition to\nthe $6.00/PMPM), providers will be required to develop a workflow to refer patients to a Social Care Network\n(SCN) and submit an attestation by March 31, 2025, confirming their SCN participation. From April 1, 2024\nthrough March 31, 2025, all NYS PCMH providers will receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should\nrefer to Column B in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nEffective April 1, 2025, NYS PCMH providers that submit SCN attestation by March 31, 2025, will continue\nto receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column C in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table\nbelow. NYS PCMH providers that do not attest to participation in an SCN will receive the $6.00/PMPM NYS\nPCMH payment without the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column D in the “NYS PCMH\nPayment” table below.\nPCMH practices can submit attestations after the March 31, 2025 deadline and the PCMH practice will be\nincluded in the subsequent participation list for the additional $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement. PCMH practices\nthat submit attestations after March 31, 2025 will forfeit the $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement beginning April 1,\n2025 until the attestation is received. NYS DOH will release more details about the attestation form and\nprocess in the coming weeks. The attestation form will be available on the NYS Health Commerce System\n(HCS) website, located at: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us/.\nThe attestation will be completed once, per physical site location, covering all recognized providers at that\nlocation. In preparation, practices should check access to their NYS Health Commerce website accounts. A\nlink to the attestation form will be emailed to all NYS PCMH practices for completion using the NYS PCMH\ncontact email address(es) on file with NCQA.\nOctober 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nIn order for MMC, HARP, HIV SNP, and CHPlus plans to calculate PCMH incentive enhancement payment,\nthere will be an “SCN Indicator” on the monthly NYS PCMH file posted to the Health Commerce System that\nwill track provider completion of the attestation. Plans will calculate provider payment based on the information\ncorresponding to the “SCN Indicator”.\nSCNs have been established via the NYS DOH 1115 Waiver Amendment, “New York Health Equity Reform”\n(NYHER). NYS DOH recently announced contracts with regional entities, which will serve as lead entities for\nthe regional SCNs. SCNs are developing networks of community-based organizations to deliver social care\nservices to eligible NYS Medicaid members.

        "text": "April 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nProper Billing for the Recipient Restriction Program\nThe Recipient Restriction Program (RRP) is a medical review and administrative mechanism whereby New\nYork State (NYS) Medicaid members with a demonstrated pattern of abusing or misusing NYS Medicaid\nservices may be restricted to a specific healthcare provider (i.e., hospital, clinic, physician) or pharmacy to\ncoordinate services. RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis. Medical claims for restricted MMC enrollees should follow guidelines established by the MMC\nPlan of the enrollee. Proper billing procedures for FFS recipients and the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program\nfor restricted recipients are explained below.\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nNYS Medicaid Claims\nFor NYS Medicaid claims, providers should refer to page 17 of the NYS Medicaid General Billing Guidelines\n– Professional, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/General_Billing_Guide\nlines_Professional.pdf. Per the New York State Medicaid Companion Guide V 4.0, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/HIPAA/5010/transactions/eMedNY_Transaction_Information_CAQH-CORE_CG_X\n12_version_5010.pdf, “when providing services to a member who is restricted to a primary physician or facility,\nthe National Provider Identifier (NPI) of the referring professional must be entered.

As a result, a restricted recipient will be required to obtain all their care, directly or by referral, from\ntheir assigned providers.\nAn assigned primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for providing direct medical care or coordinating care\nthrough referral to another medical provider for specialty services. The assigned PCP is also responsible for\nordering all non-emergency transportation, laboratory, durable medical equipment (DME), and pharmacy\nservices for the assigned restricted recipient. A referral will be needed from the assigned PCP for any non-\nemergency medical services when a specialist is required. Claims submitted for a restricted recipient will be\ndenied if information for the assigned PCP is not included on the claim as the referring provider.\nPharmacies filling prescriptions for a restricted recipient is required to coordinate with the assigned PCP to\nsafely manage the delivery of medications, including verifying referrals if prescriptions were not written by the\nassigned PCP. The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions. The pharmacy is responsible\nfor contacting the assigned PCP the next business day regarding the prescriptions obtained by the recipient.\nAn assigned primary inpatient hospital is responsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized referral.\nEmergency Pharmacy Situations\nIn the event of an emergency, such as drug shortages, unexpected pharmacy closures, and/or unexpected\ntravel, providers and pharmacies must refer to the instructions and contact information provided below.\nDuring normal business hours, the restricted recipient can obtain a temporary authorization to fill the\nprescription at an alternate pharmacy location by contacting:\n• the New York State (NYS) Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG)\nCall (518) 474-6866 or email omig.sm.rrp@omig.ny.gov (available Monday through Friday\nfrom 8 a.m. through 4 p.m.).\n• the local Department of Social Services (LDSS), if the restricted recipient received health coverage\nvia LDSS (Upstate residents).\nProviders and pharmacies should refer to the NYS Department of Health “Local Departments\nof Social Services (LDSS)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/ldss.htm.\n• the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Association (HRA), if the restricted recipient received\nhealth coverage via NYC HRA (NYC-residents).\nCall (888) 692-6116.\n• NY State of Health (NYSOH), if the restricted recipient obtained health coverage via NYSOH.\nCall (518) 457-0761 or email hxrestrict@health.ny.gov.\nDuring nights and weekends, the pharmacy can obtain a prior authorization (PA) by contacting the eMedNY\nCall Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 (available Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. through 10 p.m.\nand Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. through 5:30 p.m.).\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nAdditional Information\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. A restriction is implemented if it is found that a recipient has received duplicative,\nexcessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a recipient commits\nfraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).

OTP services are delivered\nby programs certified as Article 32 outpatient programs by the Office of Addiction Services and Supports and\nare formerly known as Methadone Maintenance Treatment programs.\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. The RRP may restrict the NYS Medicaid member to care provided by, or referred by, a\nprimary care provider, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy. A restriction is implemented if it is found\nthat the NYS Medicaid member has received a pattern of duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, or conflicting\nhealth care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a NYS Medicaid member commits fraudulent acts with their\nbenefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).\nMarch 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nOTP services including methadone maintenance treatment are fully-exempt from all RRP coverage and\npayment restrictions. Consequently, all NYS Medicaid MMC Plans must cover medically necessary opioid\nuse disorder services delivered in an OTP for RRP-identified NYS Medicaid members without any additional\nRRP restrictions, edits, authorizations, or referral requirements, and claims for OTP services must not be\ndenied due to RRP restrictions.\nProvider Billing:\n• For FFS claims, Article 32 OTP providers are systemically assigned specialty code “922” in their\nprovider enrollment file and must utilize one of the following rate codes when submitting FFS claims:\n“1564”, “1567”, “7969” through “7976” (bundled rate codes), and “1671” / “2973” (Federally\nQualified Health Centers). A system update to eMedNY claims processing, to enhance the bypassing\nof OTP FFS claims on a restricted recipient, is currently in progress with an anticipated release date\nof July 24, 2025. OASAS is working with the Department of Health Office of Health Insurance\nPrograms to ensure facilities are paid for services rendered.\n• For RRP-identified NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MMC, providers should refer to the individual\nMMC Plan for billing instructions; however, claims submitted for OTP services rendered by an Article\n32 program must not be denied due to RRP restrictions.\nAdditional RRP Resources:\n• NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) “Frequently Asked Questions for RRP\nProviders” web page (https://omig.ny.gov/frequently-asked-questions-rrp-providers)\n• NYS OMIG “Information for Managed Care in the Recipient Restriction Program (RRP)” web page\n(https://omig.ny.gov/information-managed-care-recipient-restriction-program-rrp)\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• RRP-specific questions should be directed to the NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General RRP\nHelpline by telephone at (518) 474-6866 or by email at omig.sm.RRP@omig.ny.gov.\n• FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\nDivision of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at\nFFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nMMC Plan of the enrollee.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers – Managed Care Information document, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.",

VFCAs are no longer the payor for services provided to this population; providers will\nbe reimbursed directly by Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or the child’s/youth’s MMC Plan.\nMMC Plans have already established, and will continue to offer, contracts with community providers with\nexpertise in working with and treating the foster care population. Pharmacies and other providers serving this\npopulation are strongly encouraged to enroll in the NYS Medicaid program and engage with MMC Plans in\ntheir area to ensure continued coverage for their patients. LDSS are reminded of the critical importance to\nverify and/or establish Medicaid immediately upon a child/youth entry into foster care to prevent potential\ndelays in coverage and/or payment below:\n• Medicaid coverage for an eligible child/youth will be retroactive to the beginning of the month in which\nthe child/youth enters foster care.\n• Enrollment in the child’s/youth’s selected MMC Plan will be retroactive to the beginning of the month\nin which the Medicaid case was established.\nDecember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nUpon establishment of Medicaid coverage and issuance of a Medicaid Client Identification Number (CIN),\nclaims for services provided during this retroactive coverage period can be billed to the child/youth MMC Plan\nfor the period during which plan coverage applies, or to eMedNY for the FFS coverage period. Providers are\nencouraged to work collaboratively with the LDSS and the VFCA if there is a service need prior to the CIN\nbeing issued and are reminded to honor letters of coverage, as instances may arise where children/youth\nrequire immediate and medically necessary services prior to receiving identification (ID) cards.\nNYS has recently amended the utilization review guidelines to extend the prohibition on utilization reviews\nfrom no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan to no earlier than April 1, 2022\nor no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan, whichever is later.

The\nMedicaid-covered children/youth in foster care can either be in the care of Voluntary Foster Care Agencies\n(VFCAs) or be in foster homes certified by Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) statewide. Their\nenrollment in MMCP can include Mainstream MMCP and HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV-SNP).\nBeginning in February 2021, the State will license qualified VFCAs pursuant to Article 29-I of the New York\nState Public Health Law (visit: http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: for Laws of New York,\nthen select “PBH” for Public Health, then navigate to Article 29-I) to deliver a limited set of health-related\nservices to children/youth in their care. In accordance with the 29-I Health Facility Billing Guidance, Medicaid\nwill cover health and behavioral health services provided to eligible children/youth by licensed 29-I Health\nFacilities. Effective July 1, 2021, MMC Plans will begin covering 29-I Health Facility services for their\neligible members.\nEffective February 1, 2021, the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) Program will update the Medicaid Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out List with additional drug(s)/drug classes and products listed on the Preferred Diabetic\nSupply Program. VFCAs will continue to cover the cost of drugs/products that are not included on the Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out list until June 30, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, all pharmacy benefits for this\npopulation will be paid for under Medicaid FFS.\nAll providers who deliver services to children/youth in foster care or to children/youth in the care of VFCAs\nshould be aware of this transition. Effective July 1, 2021, VFCAs will no longer be the payor for Medicaid\ncovered services delivered to children/youth in their care, and community providers serving these children will\ndirect claims to the child/youth’s MMCP or the Medicaid FFS, as applicable.
