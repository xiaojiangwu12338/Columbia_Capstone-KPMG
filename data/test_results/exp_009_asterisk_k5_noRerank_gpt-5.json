Renewal notices will include the deadline to take action to renew their insurance or risk having a gap\nin coverage. Deadlines will be based on the member/enrollee enrollment end dates and will range from June\n30, 2023, through May 31, 2024. During this time, NY State of Health, the Official Health Plan Marketplace\n(Marketplace), will keep enrollment open to allow consumers who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or\nEP to stay covered by enrolling in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP).\nContinued on Page 3",

Skilled Nursing Facility Billing for Audio-Visual Telehealth\nWhen the services of the telehealth practitioner are included in the nursing home rate, the telehealth\npractitioner must bill the nursing home. If the services of the telehealth practitioner are not included in the\nnursing home rate, the telehealth practitioner should bill NYS Medicaid as if practitioner saw the NYS Medicaid\nmember in-person. The CPT code billed should be appended with the applicable telehealth modifier.\nPractitioners providing services via telehealth should confirm with the nursing facility whether their services\nare in the nursing home rate.\nP. MMC Considerations:\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by NYS Medicaid FFS\nand included in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. To allow DOH to adequately track telehealth use,\nMMC Plans must ensure claims allow the use of the telehealth modifiers established in this guidance\nand may establish additional claiming requirements beyond those set out in the FFS billing\ninstructions in this guidance.\n2.

FQHCs That Have \"Opted Into\" APGs: FQHCs that have \"opted into\" APGs should follow the billing\nguidance outlined above for sites billing under APGs.\n2. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter, is\nprovided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site may bill\nthe Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC off-site services rate code\n(“4012”).\n3. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4. Wrap payments are available for any telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by\nan MMC Plan, under qualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nD. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nTelephonic (Audio-only)\nSee Section II: Telephonic Reimbursement Overview.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth modifier \"GQ”.\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [Collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography {ECG}, blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other\nqualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation (when\napplicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nE. Medicaid Managed Care Considerations\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by Medicaid FFS and also\nincluded in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4. Questions regarding MMC reimbursement and/or documentation requirements should be directed to\nthe member's MMC Plan.\nVIII. Options to Support Members with Limited or Lack of Access to\nDevices and Services\nThe following is a listing of helpful resources compiled for emergency assistance:\n• Free Wi-Fi/internet\nCharter Communications (Spectrum) and Comcast are giving households with K-12 and\ncollege students, and those who qualify as low-income complimentary Wi-Fi for 60 days.\nFamilies who do not have the service will also receive free installation of the service.\nBoth companies are expanding Wi-Fi hotspots to the public within the company’s available\nregions.\nCall (844) 488-8395 (Charter) or (855) 846-8376 (Comcast) to enroll.\nIndividuals must call company after 60 days, or they will be automatically billed.\n• Unlimited data\nCharter, Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon are offering unlimited data plans to customers until May\n13, 2021, for no additional charge.\n• SafeLink Wireless\nEligibility requirements must be met, which are set by each State where the service is provided.\nTo qualify for Lifeline, subscribers must either have an income that is at or below 135 percent\nof the federal Poverty Guidelines, or participate in one of the following assistance programs:\n Medicaid\n Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Food Stamps\n Supp",

Such audit or inspection would be\nperformed by the NYS Department of Health (Department), Office of the Medicaid Inspector General\n(OMIG), the Office of the State Comptroller (OSC), the NYS Office of the Attorney General and/or other\nstate or federal agencies, for the period required by federal or state statute, regulation, policy or contract.\nAdditionally, for any claims submitted to NYS Medicaid with a zero-fill reimbursement from Medicare or\nother third-party insurers, providers must retain evidence that the claims were denied by the other insurers\nbefore seeking reimbursement from NYS Medicaid. Exceptions to this policy would be for claims reflecting\nitems or services that are statutorily not covered by the Medicare program. Providers may bill NYS Medicaid\ndirectly without receiving denials from Medicare for these exceptions. Providers are responsible for retaining\nthe statutory exemption from Medicare for audit or inspection.\nThe Department reviewed zero-filled claim submissions and collected information from providers for\nanalysis of claims. These reviews and subsequent analysis are meant to assist providers with proper claim\nsubmission and appropriate use of zero-fill. For further information regarding the primary issues that were\nfound during the review, please reference to eMedNY’s Submission Guidance for Claims with Third Party\nLiability (Medicare or Other Insurance) document.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• General questions regarding claims submission should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at\n(800) 343-9000.\n• Questions regarding specific medical pended claims should be directed to the Bureau of Medical\nReview, Pended Claims Unit at (800) 342-3005 (option 3).\n• Questions regarding specific dental pended claims should be directed to the Bureau of Dental Review,\nPended Claims Unit at (800) 342-3005 (option 2).",

As a result, and to expedite and simplify the enrollment\nprocess, the Department of Health’s Bureau of Provider Enrollment has taken action to implement\nthe following:\n(i) Create an online Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application process that\nallows physicians, registered physician assistants (RPAs), nurse practitioners (NPs),\nregistered nurses (RNs), and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to enroll on a temporary basis\nfor the purpose of assisting with COVID-19 activities;\n(ii) Allow a retroactive effective date no earlier than March 1, 2020, for Provisional Temporary\nProvider Enrollments;\n(iii) Waive application fees for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment applications;\n(iv) Waive the screening requirements of site visits and fingerprint-based Criminal Background\nChecks for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollments;\n(v) Allow providers who are enrolled in either Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program to\nenroll in NY Medicaid as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vi) Allow providers who are licensed outside of New York State to render services to Medicaid\nmembers during the public health emergency as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vii) Allow credentialing offices to submit multiple provider enrollments using a spreadsheet,\nprovided by eMedNY; and\n(viii) Enroll providers who are not enrolled in Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program if the\nrequested data is provided on the Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application and\nthe provider: 1) is not currently excluded from NYS Medicaid; 2) does not appear on the Office\nof Inspector General (OIG) Exclusions Database; and 3) is licensed and legally authorized to\npractice or deliver the service for which they file claims in at least one state or territory.\nContinued on page 3\n\nAndrew M.

Treatment in place\nmust be provided by a licensed healthcare practitioner [physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician\nassistant (PA)], either in person or via telehealth. Non-hospital alternative destinations include Community\nMental Health Centers (CMHCs), substance use disorder treatment centers, Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHCs), physician’s offices, and urgent care facilities. For more information about the ET3 Model\nin NYS Medicaid, providers can refer to the article titled The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport\nModel with the Department of Health Parallel Model, published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu\n_no13_nov21_pr.pdf.\nNYS Department of Health (DOH) is pleased to announce that on February 16, 2022, NYS Medicaid\npaid its first ET3 ambulance claim for treatment in place. This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.",

        "text": "December 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nAttention Ambulance Services:\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nEmergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3) Model\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has invited twenty-five (25) New York State (NYS)\nambulance suppliers and providers to participate in its Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3)\nModel. Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model. Ambulance\nproviders or suppliers that have not been approved by CMS are ineligible for participation in\nNYS Medicaid ET3 Model.\n• A copy of the submitted CMS ET3 Model application and all supporting documents.\n• An affirmation, signed by the chief executive officer of the organization, agreeing to provide the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) with copies of all quality improvement and other reports required by\nCMS.\n• Evidence of outreach to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in the region to coordinate\nnetwork and payment issues for both treat in place (including telehealth) and alternative\ndestinations.\nAll applications and any questions on the Medicaid component of the ET3 Model may be submitted\nelectronically to medtrans@health.ny.gov.",

New York State routinely completes surveillance activities to evaluate compliance with the following\nappointment availability standards, (Medicaid Model Contract 15.2, Appointment Availability Standards):\n• For urgent care: within twenty-four (24) hours of request.\n• Non-urgent “sick” visit: within forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated.\n• Routine non-urgent, preventive appointments except as otherwise provided in this Section: within four\n(4) weeks of request.\n• Initial prenatal visit: within three (3) weeks during first trimester, within two (2) weeks during the second\ntrimester and within one (1) week during the third trimester.\n• Adult baseline and routine physicals: within twelve (12) weeks from enrollment.\n• Well child care: within four (4) weeks of a request;\n• Initial family planning visits: within two (2) weeks of request.\n• Members must reach a live voice when calling a provider after-hours (i.e., an answering service).\nMMC Plans must require contracted PCPs and OB/GYNs to have the primary responsibility serving as the after-\nhours “on-call” telephone resource to members with medical problems. Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medical/surgical supplies.\nThe complete list of items subject to the Pharmacy Benefit Carve-Out can be reviewed in the Carve-Out\nScope web page. Please Note: Physician administered (J-Code) drugs that are not listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies\n(DMEPOS) as listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and\nSupplies Manual are not subject to the carve-out.

This expansion, approved on March 24, 2022 by the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in State Plan Amendment (SPA) #21-0026, includes sickle cell\ndisease (SCD) as a single qualifying condition for Health Homes Serving Adults (HHSA) and Health Homes\nServing Children (HHSC). Please note: Medicaid State Plan Amendment (#21–0026) can be accessed via\nthe NYS DOH “Medicaid Health Homes - State Plan Amendments” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_health_homes/med_spa.htm.\nIndividuals enrolled in the NYS Medicaid Health Home program must also meet appropriateness criteria,\nwhich includes significant behavioral, medical, or social risk factors requiring intensive care management\nservices, and have:\n• two or more chronic conditions, or\n• one single qualifying condition, such as:\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or\nserious mental illness (SMI) (adults), or\nserious emotional disturbances (SED), or\ncomplex trauma (children), or\nnew: SCD.\nThe inclusion of SCD as a single qualifying condition recognizes the unique challenges in access to services\nfaced by individuals with SCD, their families and/or supports. One key focus is to ensure effective transition\nof young adults with SCD from pediatric to adult care. These individuals often face difficulty accessing\nservices, including finding adult specialists who accept patients with SCD, who understand SCD, and who\nacknowledge the patient’s readiness for self-management. Additional challenges include:\n• managing the comorbidities associated with SCD,\n• understanding pain and pain control/management issues,\n• recognizing self-care and self-efficacy,\n• acknowledging and addressing social determinants of health,\n• connecting to community support services (such as peer supports) and appropriate educational\ninformation.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Questions should be directed to the Health Home program at healthhomes@health.ny.gov.\n• For information regarding the implementation of the NYS Medicaid Health Home program, providers\ncan refer to the April 2012 Special Edition Medicaid Update titled Introducing Health Homes Improving\nCare for Medicaid Recipients with Chronic Conditions, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2012/april12muspec.pdf.",

In 2018, NYS DOH\ncollaborated with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), creator of the PCMH program, to\ndevelop this exclusive transformation model for all eligible primary care providers in NYS. At that time, the\nAdvanced Primary Care (APC) Incentive Payment program ended to allow for the NYS implementation and\ntransition into the NYS PCMH model. Additional information regarding NYS PCMH can be found on the NCQA\n“New York State Patient-Centered Medical Home (NYS PCMH) Recognition Program” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/programs/health-care-providers-practices/state-and-government-recognition/nys-\npatient-centered-medical-home/.\nProviders that achieve NYS PCMH recognition are eligible to receive payments provided in the form of either\nper member per month (PMPM) capitation payments for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC), including\nmainstream NYS Medicaid, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-\nSpecial Needs Plans (HIV-SNPs), and Child Health Plus (CHPlus) members; or as a per-visit \"add-on\"\npayment for eligible claims billed for services provided to NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members.\nProviders should refer to Column A in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nNYS PCMH Managed Care Incentive\nRetroactive to April 1, 2024, primary care providers recognized under the NYS PCMH program are entitled to\nan incentive enhancement of $4.00/PMPM for MMC enrollees and CHPlus members under 21 years of age,\nand $2.00/PMPM for individuals 21 years of age and older, in addition to the current $6.00/PMPM payment.\nMMC Plans will be expected to calculate retroactive payments and furnish these payments to NYS PCMH-\nrecognized providers in their networks. In 2025, to receive this enhanced incentive payment (in addition to\nthe $6.00/PMPM), providers will be required to develop a workflow to refer patients to a Social Care Network\n(SCN) and submit an attestation by March 31, 2025, confirming their SCN participation. From April 1, 2024\nthrough March 31, 2025, all NYS PCMH providers will receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should\nrefer to Column B in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nEffective April 1, 2025, NYS PCMH providers that submit SCN attestation by March 31, 2025, will continue\nto receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column C in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table\nbelow. NYS PCMH providers that do not attest to participation in an SCN will receive the $6.00/PMPM NYS\nPCMH payment without the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column D in the “NYS PCMH\nPayment” table below.\nPCMH practices can submit attestations after the March 31, 2025 deadline and the PCMH practice will be\nincluded in the subsequent participation list for the additional $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement. PCMH practices\nthat submit attestations after March 31, 2025 will forfeit the $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement beginning April 1,\n2025 until the attestation is received. NYS DOH will release more details about the attestation form and\nprocess in the coming weeks. The attestation form will be available on the NYS Health Commerce System\n(HCS) website, located at: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us/.\nThe attestation will be completed once, per physical site location, covering all recognized providers at that\nlocation. In preparation, practices should check access to their NYS Health Commerce website accounts. A\nlink to the attestation form will be emailed to all NYS PCMH practices for completion using the NYS PCMH\ncontact email address(es) on file with NCQA.\nOctober 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nIn order for MMC, HARP, HIV SNP, and CHPlus plans to calculate PCMH incentive enhancement payment,\nthere will be an “SCN Indicator” on the monthly NYS PCMH file posted to the Health Commerce System that\nwill track provider completion of the attestation. Plans will calculate provider payment based on the information\ncorresponding to the “SCN Indicator”.\nSCNs have been established via the NYS DOH 1115 Waiver Amendment, “New York Health Equity Reform”\n(NYHER). NYS DOH recently announced contracts with regional entities, which will serve as lead entities for\nthe regional SCNs.

OTP services are delivered\nby programs certified as Article 32 outpatient programs by the Office of Addiction Services and Supports and\nare formerly known as Methadone Maintenance Treatment programs.\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. The RRP may restrict the NYS Medicaid member to care provided by, or referred by, a\nprimary care provider, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy. A restriction is implemented if it is found\nthat the NYS Medicaid member has received a pattern of duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, or conflicting\nhealth care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a NYS Medicaid member commits fraudulent acts with their\nbenefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).\nMarch 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nOTP services including methadone maintenance treatment are fully-exempt from all RRP coverage and\npayment restrictions. Consequently, all NYS Medicaid MMC Plans must cover medically necessary opioid\nuse disorder services delivered in an OTP for RRP-identified NYS Medicaid members without any additional\nRRP restrictions, edits, authorizations, or referral requirements, and claims for OTP services must not be\ndenied due to RRP restrictions.\nProvider Billing:\n• For FFS claims, Article 32 OTP providers are systemically assigned specialty code “922” in their\nprovider enrollment file and must utilize one of the following rate codes when submitting FFS claims:\n“1564”, “1567”, “7969” through “7976” (bundled rate codes), and “1671” / “2973” (Federally\nQualified Health Centers). A system update to eMedNY claims processing, to enhance the bypassing\nof OTP FFS claims on a restricted recipient, is currently in progress with an anticipated release date\nof July 24, 2025. OASAS is working with the Department of Health Office of Health Insurance\nPrograms to ensure facilities are paid for services rendered.\n• For RRP-identified NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MMC, providers should refer to the individual\nMMC Plan for billing instructions; however, claims submitted for OTP services rendered by an Article\n32 program must not be denied due to RRP restrictions.\nAdditional RRP Resources:\n• NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) “Frequently Asked Questions for RRP\nProviders” web page (https://omig.ny.gov/frequently-asked-questions-rrp-providers)\n• NYS OMIG “Information for Managed Care in the Recipient Restriction Program (RRP)” web page\n(https://omig.ny.gov/information-managed-care-recipient-restriction-program-rrp)\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• RRP-specific questions should be directed to the NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General RRP\nHelpline by telephone at (518) 474-6866 or by email at omig.sm.RRP@omig.ny.gov.\n• FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\nDivision of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at\nFFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nMMC Plan of the enrollee.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers – Managed Care Information document, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.",

The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions.

        "text": "April 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nProper Billing for the Recipient Restriction Program\nThe Recipient Restriction Program (RRP) is a medical review and administrative mechanism whereby New\nYork State (NYS) Medicaid members with a demonstrated pattern of abusing or misusing NYS Medicaid\nservices may be restricted to a specific healthcare provider (i.e., hospital, clinic, physician) or pharmacy to\ncoordinate services. RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis. Medical claims for restricted MMC enrollees should follow guidelines established by the MMC\nPlan of the enrollee. Proper billing procedures for FFS recipients and the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program\nfor restricted recipients are explained below.\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nNYS Medicaid Claims\nFor NYS Medicaid claims, providers should refer to page 17 of the NYS Medicaid General Billing Guidelines\n– Professional, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/General_Billing_Guide\nlines_Professional.pdf.

It is required that children in foster care are up to three\nyears of age have their mouths examined at such medical examination and, where appropriate, referred for\ndental care. Children in foster care over the age of three are required to see a dentist at minimum, once a\nyear, and must be provided dental care when needed.\nChildren may enter foster care having never seen a dentist. It is critical that these children receive expedited\naccess to care. Providers must consider making an extra effort to accommodate these children into their\ndental practice by ensuring availability of appointments. As a reminder, the cost of analgesic and anesthetic\nagents, including nitrous oxide, is included in the reimbursement for dental services under the NYS Medicaid\ndental policy, which is available in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program Dental Policy and\nProcedure Code Manual, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Dental/PDFS/Dental_\nPolicy_and_Procedure_Manual.pdf.

The\nMedicaid-covered children/youth in foster care can either be in the care of Voluntary Foster Care Agencies\n(VFCAs) or be in foster homes certified by Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) statewide. Their\nenrollment in MMCP can include Mainstream MMCP and HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV-SNP).\nBeginning in February 2021, the State will license qualified VFCAs pursuant to Article 29-I of the New York\nState Public Health Law (visit: http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: for Laws of New York,\nthen select “PBH” for Public Health, then navigate to Article 29-I) to deliver a limited set of health-related\nservices to children/youth in their care. In accordance with the 29-I Health Facility Billing Guidance, Medicaid\nwill cover health and behavioral health services provided to eligible children/youth by licensed 29-I Health\nFacilities. Effective July 1, 2021, MMC Plans will begin covering 29-I Health Facility services for their\neligible members.\nEffective February 1, 2021, the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) Program will update the Medicaid Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out List with additional drug(s)/drug classes and products listed on the Preferred Diabetic\nSupply Program. VFCAs will continue to cover the cost of drugs/products that are not included on the Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out list until June 30, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, all pharmacy benefits for this\npopulation will be paid for under Medicaid FFS.\nAll providers who deliver services to children/youth in foster care or to children/youth in the care of VFCAs\nshould be aware of this transition. Effective July 1, 2021, VFCAs will no longer be the payor for Medicaid\ncovered services delivered to children/youth in their care, and community providers serving these children will\ndirect claims to the child/youth’s MMCP or the Medicaid FFS, as applicable. To avoid disruption in services\nto children/youth during this transition, providers traditionally serving this population are strongly encouraged\nto enroll in the NYS Medicaid program then engage with MMCP in their area to ensure continued coverage\nfor their patients.\nPolicy requirements for this transition, including continuity of care requirements for transitioning children/youth\nenrolling in Medicaid managed care, 29-I Health Facility rate information, and 29-I Health Facility services\nguidelines, can be located on the Department of Health’s 29-I Health Facility (VFCA Transition) web page.\nQuestions\nAll questions may be directed to BH.transition@health.ny.gov.",

VFCAs are no longer the payor for services provided to this population; providers will\nbe reimbursed directly by Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or the child’s/youth’s MMC Plan.\nMMC Plans have already established, and will continue to offer, contracts with community providers with\nexpertise in working with and treating the foster care population. Pharmacies and other providers serving this\npopulation are strongly encouraged to enroll in the NYS Medicaid program and engage with MMC Plans in\ntheir area to ensure continued coverage for their patients. LDSS are reminded of the critical importance to\nverify and/or establish Medicaid immediately upon a child/youth entry into foster care to prevent potential\ndelays in coverage and/or payment below:\n• Medicaid coverage for an eligible child/youth will be retroactive to the beginning of the month in which\nthe child/youth enters foster care.\n• Enrollment in the child’s/youth’s selected MMC Plan will be retroactive to the beginning of the month\nin which the Medicaid case was established.\nDecember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nUpon establishment of Medicaid coverage and issuance of a Medicaid Client Identification Number (CIN),\nclaims for services provided during this retroactive coverage period can be billed to the child/youth MMC Plan\nfor the period during which plan coverage applies, or to eMedNY for the FFS coverage period. Providers are\nencouraged to work collaboratively with the LDSS and the VFCA if there is a service need prior to the CIN\nbeing issued and are reminded to honor letters of coverage, as instances may arise where children/youth\nrequire immediate and medically necessary services prior to receiving identification (ID) cards.\nNYS has recently amended the utilization review guidelines to extend the prohibition on utilization reviews\nfrom no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan to no earlier than April 1, 2022\nor no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan, whichever is later. Policy\nrequirements for this transition, including continuity of care requirements for transitioning children/youth\nenrolling in MMC, can be found on the Department of Health (DOH) “29-I Health Facility (VFCA transition)”\nwebsite at https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/behavioral_health/children/vol_foster_\ntrans.htm.

Providers who demonstrate\nMeaningful Use (MU) of their EHR systems are leading the way towards interoperability, which is the ability of\nhealthcare providers to exchange and use patient health records electronically. The ultimate goal is to increase\npatient involvement, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nHow does using EHR promote interoperability?\n• Providers are ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is private, secure, and easily useable by\nthe patient, their family, and by other providers - current and future;\n• There is full and easy access to all electronic health information that is authorized for such; and\n• There is protection against information blocking – when a provider, vendor, or information technology (IT)\ndeveloper knowingly and unreasonably interferes with the exchange and use of electronic health\ninformation. Examples of information blocking include: fees that make data exchange cost prohibitive;\norganizational policies that prohibit the exchange of information; or when patients or health care providers\nbecome “locked in” to a specific technology or health care network because data are not portable.\nImportant Note:\nAll EPs attesting to Payment Year (PY) 2019 Stage 3 MU must use 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record\nTechnology (CEHRT).\nRegister in MURPH: Stage 3 Objective 8 (Public Health)\nEPs must register their intent to submit data to the appropriate Public Health registries before or within 60 days\nfrom the start of their EHR Reporting Period. Providers who are using the EHR period starting January 1, 2019\nfor PY 2019 MU, must register by March 1st, 2019. EPs who previously registered with the Meaningful Use\nRegistration System for Public Health (MURPH) must use or update their existing MURPH registration rather\nthan start a new registration.\nFor questions please contact the New York Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Support Team at: 1-877-646-5410\n(option 3), or via email at: MUPublicHealthHelp@health.ny.gov\nNYS RECs\nNew York State (NYS) Regional Extension Centers (RECs) offer support to help providers meet their objectives.\nAnswers to questions regarding the program and requirements, assistance on selecting and using CEHRT, or\nhelp meeting program objectives is available?
