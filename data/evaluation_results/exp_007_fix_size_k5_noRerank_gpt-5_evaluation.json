To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of t",

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medi",

A\nlink to the attestation form will be emailed to all NYS PCMH practices for completion using the NYS PCMH\ncontact email address(es) on file with NCQA.\nOctober 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nIn order for MMC, HARP, HIV SNP, and CHPlus plans to calculate PCMH incentive enhancement payment,\nthere will be an “SCN Indicator” on the monthly NYS PCMH file posted to the Health Commerce System that\nwill track provider completion of the attestation. Plans will calculate provider payment based on the information\ncorresponding to the “SCN Indicator”.\nSCNs have been established via the NYS DOH 1115 Waiver Amendment, “New York Health Equity Reform”\n(NYHER). NYS DOH recently announced contracts with regional entities, which will serve as lead entities for\nthe regional SCNs. SCNs are developing networks of community-based organizations to deliver social care\nservices to eligible NYS Medicaid members.

RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member i",
