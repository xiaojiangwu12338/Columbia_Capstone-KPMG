For dates-of-service (DOS) on or after January 1, 2025, doulas\nwho have a contract with an MMC Plan will be reimbursed by the MMC Plan for all eligible doula services. After MMC carve-out period (January 1, 2025, and after), if an MMC enrollee is receiving services prior\nto January 1, 2025, MMC Plans are required to cover the doula services and continue the NYS Medicaid\nFFS equivalent until 12 months after the end of the pregnancy, regardless of pregnancy outcome. Additionally,\nrequirements include the following:\n• The doula is required to begin billing the MMC Plan of the enrollee for DOS on or after January 1,\n2025;\n• The MMC Plan is required to ensure continuity of care for these services for MMC enrollees, even if\nthe doula is not contracted with the MMC Plan as of January 1, 2025. Please note: This only applies\nif the MMC enrollee was receiving services from the billing doula prior to January 1, 2025.",
