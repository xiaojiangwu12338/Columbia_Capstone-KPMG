The policy also establishes procedures for conducting a transfer from\nHHSC to C-YES for children/youth who opt-out of HH care management but choose to continue\nreceiving HCBS through enrollment in the Children’s Waiver.\nBackground\nEffective April 1, 2019, the 1915(c) Children’s Waiver became operational across New York\nState. This waiver allows children/youth to access an aligned array of HCBS to address their\nneeds, goals, and preferences as detailed in their Person-Centered Plan of Care (POC).\nThe 1915 (c) Children’s Waiver participants must receive care management services as\npart of waiver services. Children’s Waiver Medicaid participants are eligible for HHSC. If the\nchild/family elects to receive care management from a HH, the Health Home Care Manager\n(HHCM) determines a child/youth’s eligibility for HCBS waiver participation by conducting the\nHCBS/Level of Care (LOC) Eligibility Determination1. If the child/youth is found HCBS eligible,\nthe HHCM conducts person-centered care planning to develops a comprehensive POC and\nensures the POC supports the child/youth’s functional development within the community.\nFor children/youth who opt out of HH, the State’s Independent Entity (IE), C-YES, conducts the\nHCBS/Level of Care (LOC) Eligibility Determination to determine a child/youth’s eligibility for\nHCBS waiver participation and develops a person-centered POC for HCBS only. C-YES\nprovides care coordination and maintains the POC for HCBS eligible waiver children/youth in\nfee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid. For waiver enrolled children/youth who opt of HH and are\nenrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care Plan (MMCP), the MMCP provides care management and\nmaintains the POC; C-YES coordinates at least quarterly with MMCP regarding the child/youth’s\nHCBS POC.\nAdditionally, C-YES will work with children/youth and their families who are not currently\nMedicaid enrolled when they need or request HCBS. For children/youth who are not already\nenrolled in Medicaid, C-YES will conduct the HCBS/LOC Eligibility Determination and will assist\nthe child/family with their Medicaid application. Once enrolled in Medicaid, the child/youth has a\nchoice to transfer to HH care management or stay with C-YES for HCBS only care\ncoordination.\n1 Refer to the Children’s Waiver Enrollment policy for additional information.\nJanuary 2021 Page 1 of 6", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}

In either circumstance, C-YES will educate the child/youth/family about HH care\nmanagement, C-YES care coordination, and HCBS eligibility and services. For\nchild/youth already enrolled in Medicaid, the child/youth/family may choose if they would\nlike to proceed with the HCBS/LOC eligibility process with C-YES or be connected to a\nHH to be enrolled so the HH care manager can conduct the HCBS/LOC eligibility\ndetermination.\n2. C-YES will work with the child/family to complete the HCBS/LOC Eligibility Determination\nand, if determined HCBS eligible and the child/youth/family want to proceed, then C-YES\nwill assist the family with the process of applying for Medicaid.\n3. Once the child/youth’s Medicaid has been established, and they have a slot in the\nChildren’s Waiver, C-YES will educate the child/youth/family about HH care\nmanagement, C-YES, and HCBS eligibility and services, so the child/youth/family may\nmake an informed choice on how they would like to proceed.\n4. C-YES will make an appropriate referral to a Lead HHSC/CMA as chosen by the family.\nIf the child/family does not want to be referred to a HHSC/CMA, then C-YES will provide\nHCBS only care coordination.\n5.

Children/youth referred to C-YES and already enrolled in Medicaid but are not\nenrolled in HH may choose to be referred to a HH for their initial HCBS/LOC Eligibility Determination.\n3 C-YES personnel are trained to provide families with education regarding the benefits of HH care management; it\nis expected that most children/families will choose the HH option.\nJanuary 2021 Page 2 of 6", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}

It is the responsibility of the HHCM to assist in restoring active Medicaid\nstatus, if possible and when possible by working with the Local Department of Social\nServices (LDSS). In addition to ensuring the Restriction Exception (R/RE) K-codes are\nin place, HHCMs can share a print-out of the UAS HCBS/LOC eligibility if this will\nassist/verify for the LDSS that the child/youth is in the Children’s Waiver.\n• Children/youth who are receiving only HH care management services and are\nrequesting Children’s Waiver HCBS, must not be transferred to C-YES.

If the HCBS/LOC will expire in the next 30-days, the transferring entity should\ncomplete the HCBS/LOC re-assessment prior to transfer as that entity should have the\nmost up-to-date information.\n• The HCBS/LOC Eligibility Determination is active for 364 days, so at the time of transfer\na new HCBS/LOC is not necessary to be completed by the receiving entity.\n• Verification of proper recipient Restriction Exception (R/RE): K-codes must be active on\nthe child/youth’s file prior to transfer.\n• All involved providers and care team members must be notified of the transfer of care\nJanuary 2021 Page 5 of 6", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}
