This guidance\nexplains how the receipt of services are related to waiver and Medicaid eligibility for\n“Family of One” children. Specifically, the guidance explains when either Care\nManagement or HCBS are required for children to obtain eligibility for the Children’s\nWaiver and Medicaid eligibility.\nTogether, the 1915(c) Children’s Waiver and the 1115 MRT waiver authorities provide\nMedicaid eligibility for children meeting the HCBS eligibility criteria under the Children’s\nWaiver. The 1915(c) Children’s Waiver was implemented on April 1, 2019 and\nconsolidated six children’s HCBS waivers into one comprehensive waiver. The\nchildren’s 1115 MRT waiver amendment was approved on August 2, 2019 to allow\n“Family of One” to children meeting the 1915(c) Children’s Waiver criteria, who only\nreceive HH Care Management services, to retain their Waiver eligibility status. This\nallows the child to have Medicaid eligibility determined under a “Family of One” budget if\nnot otherwise eligible under community budgeting. The two authorities allow all children\nand youth eligible for the Waiver to have:\n• Greater ease of enrollment into Children’s Waiver\n• Access to all HCBS (Home and Community Based Services) as needed\n• Greater flexibility for HCBS to be delivered in natural environments for better\noutcomes\n• Retain eligibility for Medicaid if “Family of One” and eligible for the Children’s\nWaiver\nHCBS Care Management\nAll children/youth enrolled in the Children’s Waiver need care coordination services. HH\ncomprehensive care management provides the care coordination service required\nunder the Children’s Waiver. If a child/youth is eligible for the Children’s Waiver, they\nautomatically receive HH care management and a separate HH eligibility determination\nis not needed. As HH is an optional benefit, a child/family can opt-out of HH services.\nFor a child/youth who opts-out of HH services, their care coordination will be provided\nby the Independent Entity of C-YES and, if enrolled in MMCP, by the MMCP care\nmanager. A child/youth who needs HCBS, but is not enrolled in Medicaid, will be\nreferred to C-YES who will determine HCBS/LOC Eligibility and assist with establishing\nMedicaid eligibility. Once the child/youth is HCBS and Medicaid eligible, the child/family\ncan choose who they would like to provide care coordination, HH or C-YES.\n“Family of One” Medicaid Eligibility\n“Family of One” is a phrase used to describe a child that becomes eligible for Medicaid\nthrough the use of institutional eligibility rules. If a child is not otherwise eligible for\nMedicaid when counting parental income (and/or resources, if applicable), these rules\nallow for the child to have Medicaid eligibility determined as a “Family of One”, using\nVERSION 2023-1 MARCH 2023 PAGE | 139", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}

If a child/youth is not\ncurrently receiving Medicaid due to parental income (and/or resources, if applicable)\nand the child/youth is in need of waiver services, when the child/youth is found\nHCBS/LOC eligible and able to obtain a capacity slot, then based upon waiver eligibility,\nthe child will have Medicaid eligibility determined as a “Family of One”.\nNote: There is a hierarchy that must be used in determining a child/youth’s Medicaid\neligibility. This hierarchy requires that parental income information be included in the\nchild’s Medicaid application, even if the income is not ultimately used under a “Family of\nOne” budget. If the child is in a medically fragile diagnostic group or certified disabled,\nparental resource information and any income of non-waiver siblings under age 18 will\nalso need to be included on the Medicaid application. In addition, as part of the\nMedicaid eligibility determination, children/youth in a medically fragile diagnostic group\nwill have a disability determination made by the State Disability Review Team, if\ndisability status has not already been established by the Social Security Administration.\nPending the disability determination, Medicaid coverage will be authorized for such\nchildren under an ADC-related “Family of One” budget, but the child/family will be\nrequired to comply with the disability determination.\nOnce a child/youth obtains Medicaid under “Family of One” they must be\ncontinually enrolled and receiving HCBS or HH care management services (as\nnoted below) to continue their “Family of One” eligibility for the Medicaid. Any\n“Family of One” child/youth can also receive other Medicaid services (i.e. State Plan\nservices) such as Private Duty Nursing, CFTSS, pharmacy, hospital, physician, etc.\nOnce a child/youth with “Family of One” Medicaid is no longer eligible for the Children’s\nWaiver and/or doesn’t receive HCBS or HH care management, they may lose their\nMedicaid eligibility altogether or they may have to meet a large spenddown each month\nin order to access Medicaid services.\n“Community Eligible Medicaid” is when a child/youth is determined eligible for Medicaid\nbased on a budget that includes family income (and resources when applicable) in the\nbudget calculation (MAGI, ADC-related or SSI-related community budget) and is not\ntied to Children’s Waiver eligibility.\n“Family of One” and Care Management\nChildren/youth who meet HCBS/LOC eligibility (target, risk and functional) and obtain a\ncapacity slot, must be connected and in receipt of at least one HCBS on a monthly\nbasis. Under the new Children’s Waiver/1115 Waiver authorities, any “Family of One”\n(with a KK code) child/youth meeting the eligibility criteria for the 1915(c) Children’s\nWaiver must receive HH care management services or HCBS.\nFor all children/youth whether Community Eligible or “Family of One” Medicaid, a\ndetermination of services necessary must be supported by an assessment of needs and\nstrengths with the child/family and their identified care team as developed in the person-\ncentered POC.

The LDSS is responsible for entering the appropriate K-\ncodes after the child/youth is determined Medicaid eligible as outlined by Administrative\nDirective Memorandum.\nMonitoring Active Medicaid Status – Children Enrolled in Children’s Waiver\nAccording to the HH Standards and Requirements of HH, Care Management\nAgencies, and Managed Care Organizations, the HHCM must verify an individual’s\nMedicaid eligibility/status on a regular basis and prior to billing for services. The HHCM\nshould be aware of the member’s Medicaid recertification date and should assist the\nmember/family with Medicaid recertification whenever possible.\nMore information on the requirements can be found in the Consolidated Children’s\nWaiver and Medicaid Case Processing Requirements document.\nFor children/youth enrolled in the HCBS Children’s Waiver, it is imperative that\nHCBS providers verify the child/youth’s Medicaid eligibility plus HCBS enrollment\n(through eMedNY), prior to providing services and billing. HCBS providers may not\nbill while the child/youth does not have active Medicaid. If the HCBS provider\ncontinues to deliver services while the child/youth’s Medicaid enrollment is not\nactive, the provider is at risk of not recovering those costs.\nLoss of Active Medicaid – Children Enrolled in Children’s Waiver\nIf an HCBS enrolled child/youth loses their Medicaid, the HHCM or C-YES should\nreach out to the LDSS to understand the reason for the loss of Medicaid and to share\nwith the LDSS that the child/youth is enrolled in the HCBS Children’s Waiver and has\nactive K- codes. If the family’s financial situation has changed so that they are no\nlonger eligible for community Medicaid, the LDSS should conduct the “Family of One”\n(KK code) Medicaid budgeting to determine Medicaid eligibility for the child/youth,\nwhich, if found eligible, would allow the child/youth to remain in HCBS.\nHCBS enrolled children/youth receiving HH care management who lose their Medicaid\nshould not be referred to C-YES for assistance with Medicaid.

The individual must submit paid\nor incurred medically necessary bills equal to or greater than the monthly excess\nincome amount. The individual may also pay the amount of their monthly excess to the\nlocal district (for upstate residents, the County LDSS, or, for NYC residents, the HRA).\nThis is called Pay-In.\nHow Does an Individual Satisfy or Meet Their Monthly Spenddown Amount?\nWhen an individual has a monthly spenddown, it means the individual’s income is\nabove the Medicaid income limit and must “spenddown” to the Medicaid limit by\nsubmitting paid or unpaid medically necessary expenses, such as out-of-pocket medical\ncosts (co-pays for doctor appointments and/or pharmacy). The individual can also\nchoose to pay their monthly spenddown by cash/check/money order directly to their\nLDSS/HRA.\n• Medically necessary costs and Waiver Services can be utilized for the monthly\nspenddown.
