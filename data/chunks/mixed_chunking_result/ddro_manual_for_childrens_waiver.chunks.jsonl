Provisional eligibility means that a child may receive OPWDD supports or services for a\nlimited period of time. Eligibility for children who are provisionally eligible for services must be reviewed again\nby a DDRO prior to the child’s 8th birthday.\nFor children that are enrolled in the Children’s Waiver (either transitioned CAH children or new children)\nthat have OPWDD provisional eligibility, additional information regarding the child’s diagnoses and level of\nfunctioning must be submitted to the DDRO twelve months prior to the provisional eligibility expiration date\nth\n(i.e., the child’s 8 birthday). The Children’s Liaison will need to work with the HHCM/C-YES to obtain this\nadditional clinical documentation in order for the DDRO to determine if the child meets the criterial for full\nOPWDD eligibility. If updated reports are not provided by the stated deadline, the provisional eligibility will\nexpire as of the child’s eighth birthday.\n13 August 2019 Updated May 2021", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}
