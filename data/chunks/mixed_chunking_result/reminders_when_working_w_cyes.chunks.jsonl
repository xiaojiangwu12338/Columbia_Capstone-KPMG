Children/Youth Referred to the Children’s Waiver without Active Medicaid\nChildren/youth who are referred to the Children’s Waiver for HCBS and do not currently have\nactive Medicaid must initially be directed to Children and Youth Evaluation Services (C-YES). C-\nYES will conduct the HCBS Level of Care (LOC) Eligibility Determination. If the child/youth is\neligible for the Children’s Waiver, C-YES will assist the family with completing and submitting\nthe Medicaid application to the Local District of Social Services (LDSS). C-YES does not\ndetermine Medicaid eligibility, that is the role of the LDSS.\nPer the Children’s Waiver and Medicaid Case Processing Requirements ADM, the LDSS must\nfollow the standard Medicaid budgeting process to determine whether the family is eligible for\nMedicaid under “Community Eligible.” If the family is not “Community Eligible”, then the LDSS\nshould determine if the child/youth is eligible as a “Family of One” Medicaid based on their\neligibility for the Children’s Waiver. The LDSS still needs to follow the standard Medicaid\neligibility determination process and designation of “Family of One” Medicaid1.\nOnce the LDSS has determined Medicaid eligibility, it is the responsibility of the LDSS to put the\ncorresponding Recipient Restriction Exception (RR/E) codes (i.e., “K-codes”) on the\nchild/youth’s Medicaid file in the Welfare Management System (WMS) to designate Children’s\nWaiver enrollment status.\nAs a reminder, all Children’s Waiver enrollees will have a K1-code. Children/youth will also have\na K-code to indicate their target population. Children/youth determined Medicaid eligible as a\n“Family of One” will also have a KK-code to indicate this status.\nPlease note, it should not be assumed that all children/youth working with C-YES will\nhave “Family of One” Medicaid nor the KK codes. Please verify Medicaid eligibility prior\nto requesting KK-code be added to a child’s/youth’s Medicaid file.\nPlease contact capacitymanagement@health.ny.gov in the Health Commerce System under the\nsecure file transfer if there is a K-coding concern.\n1 “Family of One” Medicaid Eligibility: used to describe a child/youth that becomes eligible for Medicaid through the use of\ninstitutional eligibility rules. If a child/youth is not otherwise eligible for Medicaid when counting parental income (and/or resources, if\napplicable), these rules allow for the child/youth to have Medicaid eligibility determined as a “Family of One”, using only the\nchild/youth’s own income (and resources, if applicable).\n“Community Eligible” Medicaid Eligibility: used when a child/youth is determined eligible for Medicaid based on a budget that\nincludes family income (and resources when applicable) in the budget calculation and is not tied to Children’s Waiver eligibility.\nAugust 2021 Page 1 of 2", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}

Children/Youth Referred for Health Home Care Management through C-YES Transfer\nC-YES serves child/youth 1) who are enrolled in Medicaid and opt-out of Health Home (HH)\ncomprehensive care management or 2) who are not already enrolled in Medicaid and identified\nby a referral source (i.e., parent/doctor/school/service provider) as potentially needing HCBS.\nIn either circumstance, C-YES will educate the child/youth/family about HH care management,\nC-YES care coordination, and HCBS eligibility and services. For children/youth already enrolled\nin Medicaid, the child/youth/family may choose if they would like to proceed with the HCBS/LOC\neligibility process with C-YES or be connected to a HH to be enrolled so the HH care manager\ncan conduct the HCBS/LOC eligibility determination.\nIf the Medicaid child/youth/family is referred to C-YES and determines they want to transfer to a\nHH Care Management Agency (HH/CMA) prior to the HCBS/LOC being completed or other\ninformation being obtained, then C-YES would only need to complete the “Transfer Referral\nForm for C-YES, Health Homes, and Care Management Agencies” and not the “Opt-in to Health\nHome form” as they would not have enough information to complete this form nor could the\nHH/CMA immediately enroll the child/youth in the HH program. The HH/CMA should consider\nthis as a new member referral. *Note: C-YES may take verbal consent to refer the consumer to\nHH in this type of scenario and no specific documentation will accompany the transfer referral\nform.\nWhen documentation is needed for a transfer to HH, all required transfer documentation needs\nto be securely sent immediately and noted on the “Transfer Referral for C-YES, Health Homes,\nand Care Management Agencies” form. It is necessary for the transferring entity to obtain\nconsent from the child/youth/family to share information with the receiving entity. *Note: Clinical\ndocumentation from a third party may not be released in certain circumstances and may need a\nre-release. C-YES and HHs should discuss any information that is needed or missing in the\ntransfer and discuss how the information will be obtained. The lack of documentation is not an\nallowable reason for a delay in transfer or access to HCB Services.\nSubsequently, verification of appropriate K-codes on the transferring child/youth Medicaid file is\nnecessary. C-YES is required to monitor the K-code additions by the LDSS and, if there is a\ndelay in K-codes, should share this information with the receiving HH/CMA; however, the\ntransfer case cannot be refused for this reason. The transfer date and the HH/CMA assuming\nthe case responsibility cannot occur until the K-codes are on the child’s/youth’s Medicaid file,\nhowever, the processes of the transfer should continue and not be delayed.\nAny questions or case issues should be sent to BH.Transition@health.ny.gov\nRefer to Transfer Referral Process Between the Children and Youth Evaluation Services (C-\nYES) and Health Home Serving Children (HHSC) Policy # CW0007 for additional information.\nAugust 2021 Page 2 of 2", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Children Wavier"}
