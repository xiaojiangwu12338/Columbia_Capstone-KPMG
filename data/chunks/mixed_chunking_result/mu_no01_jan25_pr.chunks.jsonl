These guidelines are intended to standardize the decision-making process and promote\nconsistent application of inpatient admission criteria across health care facilities.\nProviders may encounter cases where patients require hospital care but do not meet inpatient admission\ncriteria. It is essential to distinguish between formal inpatient admission, which is based on a documented\nmedical order, and placement into observation status, as this distinction significantly impacts billing, and NYS\nMedicaid claim processing and payment.\nInpatient Admission Requirements\nNYS Medicaid generally follows the Two-Midnight Rule used by Medicare, which deems inpatient admission\nappropriate when the patient is expected to need hospital care for at least two midnights, ensuring that\nadmission is medically necessary, and that care cannot be provided in an outpati", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

This review is in response to a recent amendment to NYS Social Services Law §365-\nA, located at: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/SOS/365-A, effective October 1, 2024.
