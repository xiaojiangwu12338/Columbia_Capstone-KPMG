These guidelines are intended to standardize the decision-making process and promote\nconsistent application of inpatient admission criteria across health care facilities.\nProviders may encounter cases where patients require hospital care but do not meet inpatient admission\ncriteria. It is essential to distinguish between formal inpatient admission, which is based on a documented\nmedical order, and placement into observation status, as this distinction significantly impacts billing, and NYS\nMedicaid claim processing and payment.\nInpatient Admission Requirements\nNYS Medicaid generally follows the Two-Midnight Rule used by Medicare, which deems inpatient admission\nappropriate when the patient is expected to need hospital care for at least two midnights, ensuring that\nadmission is medically necessary, and that care cannot be provided in an outpatient setting. For an inpatient\nadmission order to be valid, it must be signed, before admission, by a physician directly involved with the care\nof the patient. This involvement must be documented with signed notes showing the physician examined the\npatient, contributed to the care plan, and engaged in medical decision-making. The order must be completed\nby a qualified physician (the “ordering practitioner”) who:\n• holds admitting privileges at the specific hospital, and\n• is familiar with the condition of the patient, treatment plan, and hospital needs at the time of admission.\nThe admission decision should be based on a comprehensive assessment, supported by documentation that\nreflects the need for inpatient care, such as continuous monitoring or intensive treatment. If the anticipated\nstay is less than two midnights, observation status should be considered, as it applies when the needs of the\npatient are expected to resolve within a shorter timeframe and do not warrant inpatient admission.\nTwo-Midnight Rule Exceptions\nCertain circumstances may justify inpatient admission even if the patient does not meet the two-midnight rule.\nThese exceptions include:\n• departure Against Medical Advice (AMA),\n• rapid clinical improvement,\n• transfer to another facility, and\n• patient death.\nContinued on Page 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

The decision\nof the physician should be based on the complexity of medical factors effecting the patient including patient\nhistory and comorbidities, the severity of signs and symptoms, current medical needs, and the risk of an\nadverse event. In these cases, the factors that lead to the decision to admit the patient as an inpatient must\nbe supported by the medical record.\nObservation Status Guidelines\nObservation status applies when the patient has been evaluated in the emergency department (ED) and\nadmitted for further assessment, yet a diagnosis or determination regarding admission, discharge, or transfer\ncannot be accomplished within eight hours of admission to observation but can reasonably be expected within\n48 hours. If the condition of the patient requires extended hospital care, a decision to admit as an inpatient\nshould be made. Observation status is intended for cases where it is initially unclear whether inpatient\nadmission is necessary or if the patient may be safely discharged.\nObservation status does not require an inpatient admission order. Instead, a physician or qualified practitioner\nplaces the patient in observation to assess the need for inpatient care. Documentation should indicate the\nneed for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, or additional testing to support this determination. Additional\ninformation can be found in the Direct Omit for Observation Services article published in the August 2016\nissue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program\n/update/2016/aug16_mu.pdf.\nUtilization Review\nHospitals must be diligent in their review of inpatient admissions to ensure compliance with NYS Medicaid\nbilling policies and the medical necessity requirements for inpatient claims. This involves thoroughly\nevaluating whether the medical factors documented in the medical record support the appropriateness of the\ninpatient admission, the duration of the stay and the professional services, including drugs and biologicals.\nUtilization review teams play a critical role in verifying that these criteria are met before submitting a claim to\nNYS Medicaid. All supporting documentation must be retained for ten years from the date of payment and\nmade available upon request to substantiate the claim during post-payment reviews.\nProvider Responsibilities\nTo comply with NYS Medicaid billing policies, providers must ensure their staff have a thorough understanding\nof billing requirements for inpatient admissions and observation status. Ongoing staff education, routine\ninternal audits, and regular evaluations of billing practices and workflows are critical for identifying and\nresolving gaps in compliance, documentation accuracy, and adherence to NYS Medicaid policies. By\nimplementing these measures, providers can ensure inpatient claim submissions meet NYS Medicaid\nstandards and strengthen utilization review processes.\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
