This number is used by the pharmacy to submit pharmacy claims to NYRx. All NYS\nMedicaid members are assigned a CIN even if they are enrolled in a NYS Medicaid Managed Care\n(MMC) Plan. The CIN is located on all member cards including MMC plan cards. On some MMC\ncards it is referred to as CIN; however, other MMC cards may identify it as Program ID, Member ID,\nor ID#. On some cards, it may be embedded into a longer number. The CIN is always represented\nin the following format: “XX00000X”. Please note: The sequence number is not required for\nsubmitting claims.\n• For assistance locating the CIN on an MMC Plan card, pharmacies should visit the New York State\nMedicaid Managed Care (MMC) Pharmacy Benefit Information Center website, located at:\nhttps://mmcdruginformation.nysdoh.suny.edu/.

NYS Medicaid recognizes the authority under which these unlicensed providers may\nprescribe; however, per federal requirements, these physicians are not eligible for enrollment into the NYS\nMedicaid program without a license.\nPharmacy Billing – Exceptions for Non-Enrolled Prescribers in Medicaid\nThe New York State (NYS) Medicaid program requires enrollment of all licensed prescribers who serve\nMedicaid and Medicaid Managed Care members, including prescribing practitioners, as identified on\npharmacy prescriptions, per the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and federal regulations.\nThere are two exceptions to the provider enrollment requirement:\n1.
