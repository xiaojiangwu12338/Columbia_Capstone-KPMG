Treatment in place\nmust be provided by a licensed healthcare practitioner [physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician\nassistant (PA)], either in person or via telehealth. Non-hospital alternative destinations include Community\nMental Health Centers (CMHCs), substance use disorder treatment centers, Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHCs), physician’s offices, and urgent care facilities. For more information about the ET3 Model\nin NYS Medicaid, providers can refer to the article titled The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport\nModel with the Department of Health Parallel Model, published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu\n_no13_nov21_pr.pdf.\nNYS Department of Health (DOH) is pleased to announce that on February 16, 2022, NYS Medicaid\npaid its first ET3 ambulance claim for treatment in place. This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nNY State of Health: Affordable Care Act 12th Anniversary; Congress\nEncouragement to Extend American Rescue Plan Tax Credits;\nMedicaid Resumes Eligibility Reviews, Disenrolled Members Should\nBe Directed to the Marketplace\nAs the Affordable Care Act advances into its 12th year since implementation, NY State of Health, Official\nHealth Plan Marketplace (Marketplace), is reporting record-breaking enrollment numbers. Enabled by the\nAffordable Care Act, NY State of Health has served as a critical safety net for over 6.5 million New Yorkers\nduring the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (PHE). COVID-19 PHE-related\nflexibilities and enhanced federal tax credit savings, created under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\n(ARPA), made coverage even more accessible and affordable.\nAs New York prepares for the eventual transition out of the PHE, and certain Medicaid/Children’s Health\nInsurance Program (CHIP) requirements that were waived resume, the move to conduct eligibility reviews\ncould result in many Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The availability of affordable\ncoverage through the Marketplace and the ARPA enhanced tax credits is crucial.\nMarch 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 12", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}

However, without the\nenhanced tax credit savings and when the PHE ends, individuals who transition from Medicaid and Essential\nPlan – without a monthly premium – to a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the Marketplace, may find\ncoverage too expensive, leading to significant increases in uninsured New Yorkers. Under ARPA, New\nYorkers have been receiving enhanced tax credit savings since 2021 that have saved consumers an average\nof $100 per month on QHP premium costs in 2021, making premiums the lowest they have been in years. If\nCongress does not extend these savings beyond 2022, consumers could see their monthly premiums rise by\n58 percent.\nIn the By the Numbers – Health Insurance Coverage Update document, located at: https://info\n.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/sites/default/files/Health%20Insurance%20Coverage%20Update%20by%20Congre\nssional%20District%20-%20March%202022.pdf, NY State of Health reports statistics detailing significant cost\nand coverage implications across New York’s 27 Congressional Districts, specifically relating to the\ncompletion of the PHE. In addition to enrollment data divided by Congressional District, the report also\nprovides statewide information on the negative impact the expiration of ARPA savings would have on New\nYorkers, including:\n• 6.4 million New Yorkers who are enrolled in free or low-cost coverage through NY State of Health,\nwho will need to renew their coverage to remain enrolled when the PHE winddown occurs;\n• 138,008 New Yorkers benefitting from enhanced ARPA tax credits will experience an increase in their\npremiums if these savings are not extended;\n• $1,453 (the annual total among New Yorkers could lose when ARPA subsidies expire at the end of\n2022); and\n• 58 percent (the percent by which premiums will increase for New Yorkers who are eligible for tax\ncredits when they come back to enroll in Fall 2022).\nAmidst the uncertainty of the pandemic, NY State of Health has been an essential source of stability, with\nARPA’s enhanced tax credit savings making coverage more affordable and widely accessible than ever\nbefore. The Marketplace has enrolled over 6.5 million New Yorkers in quality health plans and cut the State’s\nuninsured rate in half since the passage of the Affordable Care Act 12 years ago.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nNew York State Department of Health Medicaid Accelerated\neXchange (MAX) Workshop Series: Register for Round Two and\nUpcoming Informational Webinar\nTo further support provider efforts under value-based payment arrangements, the New York State (NYS)\nDepartment of Health (DOH) is pleased to offer Round Two of the highly rated “Medicaid Accelerated\neXchange (MAX) Workshop Series,” beginning May 2022, to improve care for individuals whose underlying\nunmet needs result in high utilization of hospitals and emergency departments (EDs).

NYS DOH has completed its annual review of all-payer breast cancer surgical volumes for\n2018 through 2020 using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database.\nOne hundred eighty hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers throughout NYS were identified as low volume.\nThese facilities have been notified of the restriction, effective April 1, 2022. The policy does not restrict a\nfacility’s ability to provide diagnostic or excisional biopsies and post-surgical care (chemotherapy, radiation,\nreconstruction, etc.) for NYS Medicaid members. For mastectomy and lumpectomy procedures related to\nbreast cancer, Medicaid members should be directed to high-volume and/or “Low-Allow” facilities.\nNYS DOH will annually re-examine all-payer SPARCS surgical volumes to revise the list of low-volume\nfacilities.
