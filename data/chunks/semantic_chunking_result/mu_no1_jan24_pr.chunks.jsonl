Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans must comply with this coverage, effective June 1, 2024.\neConsults, also known as electronic consultations or interprofessional consultations between a\ntreating/requesting provider and a consultative provider [physicians (including psychiatrists), physician\nassistants (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), midwives (MWs)], are intended to improve access to specialty\nexpertise by assisting the treating/requesting provider with the care of the patient without patient contact with\nthe consultative provider.\nThe purpose of an eConsult is to answer patient-specific treatment questions in which a consultative provider\ncan reasonably answer from information in the request for consultation and the electronic health record,\nwithout an in-person visit. The consultative provider should respond to the eConsult request within three\nbusiness days. The response should include recommendations, rationale and may include contingencies that\nwarrant a re-consult or referral. eConsults may not be appropriate for cases that involve complex decision-\nmaking and urgent medical decision-making.\neConsults cannot be used to arrange a referral for an in-person visit. They may be used for patients with or\nwithout an existing relationship with the consultative provider. For patients with an existing relationship with\nthe consultative provider, eConsults may be used upon presentation of a new problem where management\nof the patient can be reasonably carried out by the practitioner seeking the consultation.\neConsults must be performed through electronic communication between the treating/requesting provider and\nthe consultative provider. The complete record of the consult must be documented in the patient chart. Both\nthe treating/requesting provider and the consultative provider can bill for the eConsult. To bill NYS Medicaid\nfor eConsults, the provider must be enrolled in NYS Medicaid.\nPatient Rights and Consent\nThe treating/requesting provider shall provide the NYS Medicaid member with information about the eConsult\nand obtain consent from the patient prior to each eConsult. A single instance of patient consent cannot apply\nto multiple eConsults across different specialties. Written consent is not required; however, the provider must\ndocument informed consent in the chart of the patient before the eConsult. Patients have the right to refuse\nan eConsult and see a consultative provider in-person if they wish to do so.\nDocumentation and Records\nThe following information must be documented in the medical record by the treating/requesting provider:\n• the written or verbal consent made by the patient for the eConsult;\n• the request made by the treating/requesting provider; and\n• the recommendation and rationale from the consultative provider.\nBoth the treating/requesting provider and the consultative provider are required to follow all state and federal\nprivacy laws regarding the exchange of patient information.\nContinued on Page 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
