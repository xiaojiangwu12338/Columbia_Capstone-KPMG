Trained primary care providers as well as embedded behavioral health\nprofessionals provide evidence-based medications or psychosocial treatments, supported by regular\npsychiatric case consultation and treatment adjustment for patients who are not improving as expected.\nNYS Collaborative Care Medicaid Program\nSince 2015, the NYS Office of Mental Health (OMH) has supported the adoption of the CoCM in primary care\nand other physical health practices. There are more than 300 practices that are part of the program today.
