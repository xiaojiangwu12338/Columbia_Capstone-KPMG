For\npharmacies, this rule applies to all PR, which includes deductible, co-insurance, copay, and other patient\nresponsibility.\nEffective November 1, 2022, NYS Medicaid will not accept a combination of Other Coverage Code of\n\"3\" in National Council for Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP) field 308-C8 (Other Coverage Code)\nwith any reject code in field 472-6E when another third party is responsible for payment. The pre-\nadjudication edit will be expanded for this field and will return the NCPDP Reject Code (DE 3988) (6E - M/I\nOther Payer Reject Code).\nThe provider must work with the primary insurance to obtain coverage for the member.
