Once the individual\nprovides their LDSS with a completed Immediate Needs packet, the LDSS will refer their case to NYIA to\nschedule a community health assessment (CHA) and clinical appointment, to be completed in an expedited\ntimeframe.\nPlease note: This update does not apply to children under 18 years of age. LDSS will continue to perform\nthe assessments for this population and require a physician’s order form (DOH-4359 or HCSP-M11Q).\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• For more information on the Immediate Needs process under NYIA, please refer to Administrative\nDirective memorandum, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/publications/\n22adm01.htm.\n• All questions regarding NYIA and this update should be directed to\nindependent.assessor@health.ny.gov.\n***************************************************************************************************************", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

According to the\nAntimicrobial stewardship in dental practice article published on the Journal of the American Dental\nAssociation (JADA) website, located at: https://jada.ada.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0002-8177%2820%\n2930320-2#relatedArticles, “dental antibiotic prescribing contributes to approximately 10 percent of all\nantibiotic prescriptions, and an estimated 80 percent of that prescribing is deemed inappropriate.” To limit\nadverse reactions and drug resistance, the CDC stresses evidence-based prescribing on a documented\ndiagnosis, as well as using the most targeted (narrow-spectrum) antibiotic for the shortest duration possible.\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) Antibiotic Prophylaxis Prior to Dental Procedures, located at:\nhttps://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/antibiotic-prophy\nlaxis, and the American Heart Association (AHA) Prevention of Viridans Group Streptococcal Infective\nEndocarditis document, located at: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000969,\nsupport premedication for a relatively small subset of patients.\nIn general, patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental procedures should not take prophylactic\nantibiotics to prevent prosthetic joint infection.

In cases where antibiotics are deemed\nnecessary, it is most appropriate that the orthopedic surgeon recommend the appropriate antibiotic regimen\nand when reasonable, write the prescription.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• For a complete summary of the current recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental\nprocedures, dental providers should refer to the ADA Antibiotic Prophylaxis Prior to Dental Procedures,\nlocated at: https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/\nantibiotic-prophylaxis.
