Food insecurity and its associated risks are especially applicable for individuals with severe\nchronic illness. Providing MTM to medically complex individuals is one of the strategies being implemented\nby Medicaid to address food insecurity and malnutrition.\nDefinitions:\n• “ILS” is used to define an alternative physical and behavioral health service or setting, not included\nin the State Plan, that is a “medically appropriate and cost-effective” substitute for a covered service\nor setting.\n• “State approved ILS” signifies an ILS proposed by an MMCO that has been approved by the State.\n• \"State Identified ILS” signifies an ILS that is traditionally not covered under the Medicaid State Plan\nbut identified by the State as a “medically appropriate and cost-effective substitute”, under 2016\nFederal Rule 42 CFR §438.6(e), for the Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) program.\nThe use of the ILS is voluntary for MMCOs and MMC enrollees.\nState Identified ILS for MTM\nThe State Identified ILS for MTM is targeted to MMC enrollees with at least one of the following diagnoses:\ncancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)/AIDS (Acquired\nImmunodeficiency Syndrome). It will allow home delivered MTM to be available to individuals 18 years of age\nor older, living with severe illness, through a referral from a medical professional or healthcare plan. Meal\nplans will be tailored to the medical needs of the recipient by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and\ndesigned to improve health outcomes, lower cost of care, as well as increase patient satisfaction. MTM\nservices include an initial intake with a RDN, and nutritional therapy, to discuss meal composition. MTM may\nbe provided in lieu of Personal Care Aide (PCA) services hours allotted for meal preparation and food\nshopping; therefore, authorized PCA hours will be reduced for members receiving MTM services.\nNovember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

To prevent\nduplicate discounts from taking place, NYS Medicaid exclusively uses claim level identifiers on either National\nCouncil for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) or Institutional claim types (837P/837I). Additional\ninformation on the use of claim level identifiers, previously stated in the December 2016 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, in the article titled NYS Medicaid Change in 340B Claim Identification Effective 04/01/2017, can be\nfound at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2016/dec16_mu.pdf.\nClaim level identifiers are required for any 340B purchased drug billed to Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS),\nMedicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plan or as a secondary claim.

Medicaid\nregulations at 18NYCRR §540.6(e) require a provider to pursue any available other coverage prior to\nsubmitting a claim to Medicaid. If there is a responsible third party who should be paying for the Medicaid\nmember’s health benefits as primary payor, that responsible third party must pay first. As previously\ncommunicated in the October 2020 issue of the Medicaid Update, in the article titled Notification to Providers\nof Requirement to Attach Explanation of Benefits from Third-Party Payors to Medicaid Claims, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2020/docs/mu_no15_oct20.pdf, failure to\nobtain prior authorization does not overcome the responsibility of the primary payor.\nClaims for members with other coverage will deny at point of service with National Council for Prescription\nDrug Programs (NCPDP) response code/message “717- Client Has Other Insurance”.

A pharmacy provider who receives a zero-fill response must ensure that the claim was adjudicated\nwithin each TPL Plan claim process requirement. This includes submitting a claim under the appropriate\ncoverage benefit, medical or pharmacy, such as with the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System\n(HCPCS) or by National Drug Code (NDC). Additionally, a pharmacy not contracted with member TPL Plans\nmay need to attempt overrides with plans, or enroll with the plans, or advise members and prescribers of the\nneed to change dispensing to network pharmacies.\nPrescribers are responsible for prescribing per plan formulary and pursuing any claim issues such as, but not\nlimited to, the following:\n• necessary prior authorizations or appeals;\n• prescription alternatives (for a non-formulary or non-preferred drug);\n• necessary changes (quantity or day supply, etc.);\n• selection of an in-network pharmacy that is agreeable to the member; or\n• the billing of the appropriate benefit (medical versus pharmacy or HCPCS versus NDC).\nPharmacies are responsible for submitting claims to other coverage before submitting claims to Medicaid.\nPharmacies that have difficulty billing primary coverage should advise prescribers and members of potential\ndelays as well as options for resolution. If claim issues are resolved, the pharmacies may then resubmit the\nclaims to Medicaid after the claims are properly adjudicated with the TPL Plans.\nSubmitting TPL-covered claims that incorrectly bypass the TPL Plan responsibility of payment is considered\ninaccurate billing and may be subject to audit recoveries. Reminder: Providers must maintain evidence\nand documentation, which are subject to audit, for a minimum of six years following the date of\nMedicaid payment. This evidence should include, but not be limited to, denials of claims by\nresponsible TPL Plans, other applicable TPL Plan responses, and payment information.\nNovember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 16", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
