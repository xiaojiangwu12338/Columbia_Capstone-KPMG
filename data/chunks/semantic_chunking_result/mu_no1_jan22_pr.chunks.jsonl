Additionally, this article notifies FQHCs of the Managed Care Visit and Revenue (MCVR)\nupdated reporting requirements related to reimbursement received from third-party payers.\nMedicaid FFS FQHC Prospective Payment System Reimbursement After Third-Party Payers\nFQHC clinics are entitled under federal law to receive set minimum, all-inclusive Prospective Payment System\n(PPS) payments for all qualified threshold visits. The payment logic applies to all FFS claims when NYS\nMedicaid is the primary payer; it also applies to any claims when NYS Medicaid is the secondary or tertiary\npayer.\nThe eMedNY claims processing system logic is being updated to allow FQHCs and RHCs, currently\nreimbursed via the federal PPS payment rate, to be reimbursed for all claims submitted to NYS Medicaid after\nprimary commercial insurance and/or straight Medicare (Medicare Part B), or Medicare Advantage Plan\n(Medicare Part C) adjunction. This will allow FQHCs and RHCs to be paid up to the full PPS rate after primary\ninsurers’ claims adjudicate. FQHC and RHCs clinics should continue to submit their claims to NYS Medicaid\ncontaining all the payment information received from any/all primary insurance companies. Once the eMedNY\nclaims processing system changes have been operationalized, NYS Department of Health (DOH) will initiate\nqueries of all PPS claims with service dates on and after January 1, 2022, to systematically identify claims\nthat should have been paid higher amounts to reach full PPS rate. Those claims identified will automatically\nbe retroactively reprocessed by pulling back the previous FFS payments, then paying the differences to the\nFQHCs and RHCs up to the full PPS rate.\nFFS Claim Submission Update for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Supplemental Wrap\nPayments\nUnder federal law, NYS is required to make payments to FQHCs and RHCs to cover the difference between\namounts paid to the FQHCs by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs), FQHCs and RHCs cost-\nbased rate (if higher). These supplemental “wraparound” payments are made directly from NYS to FQHCs\nand RHCs via FFS claim submission, using rate code “1609”.\nEffective January 1, 2022, FQHCs and RHCs should no longer report any commercial insurance payments\non their Medicaid FFS supplemental wrap claim submissions. This change will ensure that FQHCs and RHCs\nreceive complete supplemental wrap payment. This modification may subsequently impact FQHC wrap\npayment rate calculation moving forward, as detailed below.\nMMC Visit and Revenue Report Rate Adjustment\nThe amount of each FQHC and RHC supplemental wrap payment rate is calculated on an annual basis, using\nthe most current calendar year MCVR report. The MCVR report details the MMC visit and revenue data by\nMMC Plan as well as the weighted NYS Medicaid rate used in the wrap calculation. The FQHC and RHC\nMCVR report submission, described above, supplies the data used to calculate the average MMC payment.\nThe MCVR report compares the calculated MMC average to the FQHC and RHC blended Medicaid rate for\nthe period and identifies the net difference, if any, which would be the FQHC and RHC supplemental payment\nfor the period, assuming all information is accurate.\nJanuary 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
