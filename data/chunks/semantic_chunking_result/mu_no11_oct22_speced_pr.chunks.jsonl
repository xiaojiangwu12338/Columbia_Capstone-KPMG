It contains general information\nregarding NYS transition strategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning NYS\nMedicaid members to the NYRx Pharmacy program. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional\ndetails and guidance. Detailed information regarding the NYRx Pharmacy program is available on the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) “Welcome to the NY Medicaid Pharmacy Program (NYRx)” web page, located\nat: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/mrt2/pharmacy_transition/, which is regularly\nupdated.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2023, NYS Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Medicaid Managed Care (MMC)\nPlans, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plans (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy\nbenefits through the NYRx Pharmacy program instead of through their MMC Plan. The pharmacy benefit\ntransition to NYRx does not apply to NYS Medicaid members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC)\nPlans [e.g., MLTC, Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), Medicaid Advantage Plus (MAP),\nthe Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP)]. Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from MMC to NYRx will\nprovide NYS with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the benefit, leverage\nnegotiation power, and provide a uniform list of covered drugs with standardized utilization management\nprotocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for NYS Medicaid members. NYS Medicaid consumers\nhave comprehensive drug coverage and equitable access to an extensive network of over 5,000 pharmacy\nproviders.\nContinued on Page 3\n***************************************************************************************************************", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

Please note: Physician administered drugs (commonly referred to as J-code\ndrugs) not listed on the eMedNY “Medicaid Pharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx, are not subject to the Transition. Additionally, durable medical\nequipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the New\nYork State Medicaid Program – Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies – Procedure\nCodes and Coverage Guidelines, located at: https:// www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/DME\n/PDFS/DME_Procedure_Codes.pdf, are not subject to the Transition. All mentioned items will remain the\nresponsibility of the MMC Plans.\nEffective April 1, 2023, the following NYRx Programs will also apply to NYS MMC enrollees:\n• Preferred Drug Program (PDP)\nThe PDP program, located at: https://newyork.fhsc.com/providers/PDP_about.asp, promotes the use\nof less expensive, equally effective prescription drugs when medically appropriate. All drugs currently\ncovered by NYS Medicaid remain available under the PDP and the determination of preferred and\nnon-preferred drugs does not prohibit a prescriber from obtaining any of the medications covered\nunder NYS Medicaid. The Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Board, located at: https://www.\nhealth.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/dur/index.htm, reviews drug classes and makes\nrecommendations to the Commissioner of Health regarding the selection of preferred and non-\npreferred drugs within certain drug classes.\n• Brand Less Than Generic (BLTG) Program\nThe BLTG program, located at: https://newyork.fhsc.com/providers/bltgp_about.asp, is a cost\ncontainment initiative which promotes the use of certain multi-source brand name drugs when the cost\nof the brand name drug is less expensive to the NYS, than the generic equivalent.\n• Clinical Drug Review Program (CDRP)\nThe CDRP, located at: https://newyork.fhsc.com/providers/CDRP_about.asp, is aimed to ensure that\nspecific drugs are used in a medically appropriate manner. Under the CDRP, certain drugs require\nprior authorization (PA) because there may be specific safety issues, public health concerns, the\npotential for fraud and abuse or the potential for significant overuse and misuse.\n• Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Program\nThe DUR program, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/dur/index.\nhtm, helps to ensure that prescriptions for outpatient drugs are appropriate, medically necessary, and\nnot likely to result in adverse medical consequences. DUR programs use professional medical\nprotocols and computer technology and data processing to assist in the management of data regarding\nthe prescribing of medicines and the dispensing of prescriptions over periods of time.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition – Part One: NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition pg. 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

NYS law excludes Medicaid coverage of brand\nname drugs that have a Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved A-rated generic\nequivalent, unless a PA is obtained. Drugs subject to the PDP and/or the BLTG program are not\nsubject to the MGDP.\n• Dose Optimization Program\nThe Dose Optimization program, located at: https://newyork.fhsc.com/downloads/providers/NYRx_\nPDP_PDL.pdf, can reduce prescription costs by reducing the number of pills a patient needs to take\neach day. The NYS DOH has identified the drugs that are included in this program, the majority of\nwhich have FDA approval for once-a-day dosing, have multiple strengths available in correlating\nincrements at similar costs and are currently being utilized above the recommended dosing frequency.\n• Preferred Diabetic Supply Program (PDSP)\nThe NYS Medicaid Program participates in a Preferred Diabetic Supply Program (PDSP), located at:\nhttps://newyork.fhsc.com/providers/diabeticsupplies.asp, to provide NYS Medicaid members access\nto quality glucose meters and test strips, while at the same time reducing overall program costs.\nTransition Strategy\nStakeholder Engagement\nNYS DOH began conducting monthly meetings in August 2022 with all interested stakeholders to provide\nimplementation updates, facilitate Q&A sessions, and to incorporate feedback received from sessions into\nthe workplan. For information regarding these meetings, including copies of presentations, visit the\n“Stakeholder Engagement” section of the NYS DOH “Repository” web page, located at:\nhttps://health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/mrt2/pharmacy_transition/repository/index.htm.\nData Analytics\nNYS DOH is analyzing MMC claims by program area to inform transition strategy. NYS DOH will include\ndetails regarding the analysis and transition strategy that will be used to ensure continued access to\nmedications in future stakeholder meetings.\nTransition Period\nBetween April 1, 2023, and June 30, 2023, NYS Medicaid members will be able to obtain a one-time fill for\nmedications that are non-preferred in NYRx without the normal PA requirement. This will allow additional time\nfor prescribers to switch NYS Medicaid members to a NYRx preferred medication (no PA required) or obtain\na PA for the non-preferred medication.\nPA\nPAs for drugs previously authorized by MMC Plans will be recognized and honored by NYRx following the\nTransition. MMC Plans will share the previously approved PAs with the NYS DOH. No PA will be required\nwhen NYRx PA requirements (e.g., correct diagnosis) are met, according to the enrollee’s MMC Plan claim\nhistory.\nCommunication\nCommunication regarding the Transition will be made by both NYS DOH and MMC Plans. Additionally,\ncommunication will be established through a variety of methods including general and targeted\ncommunications (e.g., future Medicaid Update articles). For information regarding these communications and\ntheir timing, providers can refer to the Transition and Communications Activities Timeline document, which\ncan be found under the “Resources & Materials” tab of the NYS DOH “Repository” web page, at:\nhttps://health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/mrt2/pharmacy_transition/repository/index.htm.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition – Part One: NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition pg. 4", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

The CIN is a unique number assigned to each NYS Medicaid member, used by a pharmacy to submit\npharmacy claims to NYRx. All NYS Medicaid members are assigned a CIN even if they are enrolled in a MMC\nPlan. The CIN is located on all NYS Medicaid member cards, including MMC Plan cards. On some MMC Plan\ncards the CIN is referred to as “CIN”; however, other MMC Plan cards may identify the CIN as “Program ID”,\n“Member ID”, or “ID#”. In other cases, the CIN may be embedded into a longer number; however, the CIN is\nalways represented in the following format: “XX00000X”.\nPlease note: The sequence number is not required for submitting claims.\nFor assistance locating the CIN on an MMC Plan card, providers should refer to the NYS MMC Pharmacy\nBenefit Information Center homepage, located at: https://mmcdruginformation.nysdoh.suny.edu/. Under the\n“Managed Care Plans” section of the homepage, providers can select from 16 different plan cards, which\nreveal exact CIN location, when selected.\nBank Identification Number (BIN) and Processor Control Number (PCN): When submitting NYRx claims\nto NYS Medicaid via NCPDP D.0, the BIN (“004740”) is required in field 101-A1.
