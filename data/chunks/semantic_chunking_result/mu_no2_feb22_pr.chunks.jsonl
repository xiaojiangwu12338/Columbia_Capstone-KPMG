The MAX program,\ndeveloped under the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program, engages and empowers\nfront-line teams of clinical and social service providers to make changes that are locally relevant and feasible,\nleveraging available resources. Among the key accomplishments have been creating new on-site workflows\nincorporating community connections to address root causes of high utilization. Action Teams have reported\nhigh worker satisfaction in the redesign of how to care for these complex patients. The MAX program provides\na vehicle for front-line provider teams to improve care, reduce the costs associated with avoidable admissions,\nand benefit under value-based payment (VBP) arrangements.\nThe goal of the “MAX Workshop Series” is to reduce avoidable hospital use, adopting the Multi-Visit Patient\n(MVP) methodology developed by Dr. Amy Boutwell, a national care transitions subject matter expert and\nconsultant. MVPs are the small percentage of patients with unmet needs that utilize a disproportionately high\namount of healthcare services, such as inpatient stays and emergency department visits, often based on non-\nmedical concerns.\nThe “MAX Workshop Series” is structured over an eight-month period with three virtual, rapid-cycle continuous\nimprovement (RCCI) workshops and weekly coaching calls held for each participating MAX Action Team. In\nthe MAX framework, hospitals form interdisciplinary teams to use RCCI to implement systems to identify\nMVPs, assess for root causes (drivers of utilization), and connect to more appropriate community supports\nand services. This ultimately creates a “MVP Care Pathway” for improved care and reduced utilization.\nDr. Boutwell has led past rounds during DSRIP’s MAX efforts and will continue to lead MAX Action Teams\nwith virtual workshop and coaching support from Island Peer Review Organization (IPRO). The next cohort\nwill be launched in Spring 2022.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• For questions and workshop enrollment assistance, providers are encouraged to contact Shannon\nWolanin by email at swolanin@ipro.org or by phone at (518) 320-3501.\n• For more information on the “MAX Workshop Series”, providers can visit the NYS DOH “Medicaid\nAccelerated eXchange (MAX) Series and MAX Training Program” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/dsrip/pps_workshops/max/2016-\n2018/index.htm.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nFebruary 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}
