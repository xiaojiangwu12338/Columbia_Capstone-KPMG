Individuals with income\nup to, and including, 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), will be eligible for the Qualified Medicare\nBeneficiary (QMB) category of the MSP. Due to this change, more individuals qualify for this benefit. Eligibility\nresponses for these individuals, in the Electronic Provider Assisted Claim Entry System (ePACES), will\nindicate active Medicare and include “QMB” as a suffix to the type of Medicare in which the individuals are\nenrolled:\nThere are no changes to the billing process for NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MSP at the QMB level.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Medicaid Medically Needy Income Level (MNIL) has\nincreased to 138 percent of the FPL. As a result, the MNIL for a single individual has increased from $934\nto $1,563, and from $1,367 to $2,106 for a couple. Further information can be found in the NYS Department\nof Health (DOH) Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP) General Information System (GIS) 22/Messages\n(MA) 11 document, located at: https://www.health. ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/publications/docs/gis/\n22ma11.pdf, which includes a sample of a one-time letter sent to impacted NYS Medicaid members informing\nthem of this change and how to request a budget recalculation from their local department of social services\n(LDSS). It is expected that the impact to many current NYS Medicaid members with excess income will\ndecrease in the amount of excess income that must be spent on medical expenses prior to NYS Medicaid\npaying the cost of medical care (e.g., a decrease or elimination of NYS Medicaid members “spenddown”\nobligation). This includes NYS Medicaid members currently enrolled in a Managed Long Term Care (MLTC)\nPlan who are currently paying their excess income (“spenddown”) amount to the MLTC Plan.\nIf a refund is due to the MLTC Plan enrollee as a result of a recalculation of income, MLTC Plans should be\nprepared to issue a refund retroactive to January 1, 2023, when updated spenddown amounts are received\nby the Plan (through a copy of a Notice with the budget change issued by the LDSS or through an 834\ntransaction).\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• MLTC Plans should direct questions to mltcinfo@health.ny.gov, with the email subject line “MLTC\nSpenddown Recalculation Refund”, or by telephone at (518) 474-6965.\n• NYS Medicaid member-specific questions regarding personal spenddown recalculations should be\ndirected to the LDSS or New York City (NYC) Human Resources Administration (HRA) of the NYS\nMedicaid member.\n***************************************************************************************************************", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}

Regardless of the dollar value associated with the\nprior authorization (PA), NYS Medicaid will provide reimbursement only for the actual costs incurred by a\ntransportation provider, while transporting a NYS Medicaid member.\nAdditionally, tolls are assessed per vehicle, not per rider, and must be billed according to the actual toll\ncharged. Therefore, if a vehicle is transporting more than one rider on the same trip, the provider may bill one\nunit per charged crossing, not one unit per passenger. E-ZPass® customers who are charged less per toll\nthan those who pay tolls with cash must bill NYS Medicaid for the actual toll amount charged to their E-\nZPass® account while transporting NYS Medicaid member(s). When submitting a claim involving parking\nor tolls, the transportation provider must input the actual costs incurred with procedure code\n“A0170”.\nThe basic tenets of this guidance are included in the New York State Medicaid Program – Transportation\nManual Policy Guidelines, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Transportation/PDFS/\nTransportation_Manual_Policy_Section.pdf.\nQuestions\nAll questions should be directed to the NYS Department of Health (DOH) Medical Transportation Unit by\ntelephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nJanuary 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}
