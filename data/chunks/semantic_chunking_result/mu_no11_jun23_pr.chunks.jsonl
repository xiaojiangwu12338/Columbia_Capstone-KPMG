New York is the 35th state to adopt a federal option included in the Biden Administration’s\nMaternity Care Action plan to extend postpartum coverage, with the overarching goal of improving maternal\nhealth, particularly in disadvantaged communities.\nThe postpartum period is critical for recovering from childbirth, addressing complications of delivery, ensuring\nmental health, managing infant care, and transitioning from obstetric to primary care. A recent release of\nmaternal mortality rates provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located at:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm, shows in\n2021, 1,205 women died of maternal causes in the United States (U.S.), compared with 861 in 2020 and 754\nin 2019. According to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicaid After Pregnancy:\nState-Level Implications of Extending Postpartum Coverage document, located at: https://aspe\n.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cf9a715be16234b80054f14e9c9c0d13/medicaid-postpartum-coverag\ne-ib%20.pdf, one in three pregnancy-related deaths occur between six weeks and one year after childbirth.\nThis option to extend NYS Medicaid and CHIP postpartum coverage is part of ongoing efforts to address\ndisparities in maternal health outcomes by opening the door to postpartum care for thousands of people.\nTo read the NYS Department of Health (DOH) announcement on this benefit extension, providers should refer\nto the NYS DOH “New York State Department of Health Extends Medicaid and Child Health Plus (CHPlus)\nPostpartum Coverage from 60 Days to One Year” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/\npress/releases/2023/2023-06-14_postpartum_extension.htm.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nJune 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
