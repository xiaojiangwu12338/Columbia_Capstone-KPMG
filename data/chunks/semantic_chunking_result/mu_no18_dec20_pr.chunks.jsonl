Exceptions to this policy would be for claims reflecting\nitems or services that are statutorily not covered by the Medicare program.

Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}
