The patient\nmust initiate the communication and the problem must require a physician or other qualified practitioner’s\nprofessional’s evaluation, assessment, and management. Claims for eVisits may not be submitted for\ncontact initiated by the provider, whether individualized or as part of an outreach program.\nCommunication of test results, scheduling appointments, medication refills, and any other communications\noutside the scope of evaluation and management are not considered eVisits.\nBilling for eVisits is based on cumulative time spent with a single patient within a seven-day period. For\nexample, if five to ten minutes are spent with a single patient for an eVisit over a seven-day period, procedure\ncode “99421” may be billed (see table below). For an encounter to qualify as an eVisit, the patient must not\nhave been seen for the same clinical issue within the previous seven days.\nPatient Rights and Consent\nThe provider shall obtain verbal or written consent for communication-based technology services (CBTS)\nannually. Written consent is not required, but the provider must document informed consent for CBTS in the\nchart of the patient before an eVisit can occur.\nDocumentation\nThe following information must be documented and retained in the medical record for each eVisit:\n• the patient-initiated inquiry and the presenting problem of the patient;\n• the clinical assessment and recommendations of the provider; and\n• the total amount of service time related to the eVisit.\nAugust 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
