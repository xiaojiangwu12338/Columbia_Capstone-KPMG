Doula\nservices provided to MMC enrollees between March 1, 2024 and March 31, 2025, will continue to be billed to\nMedicaid fee-for-service (FFS). Effective April 1, 2025, doula services will be covered by MMC Plans\n[inclusive of mainstream MMC Plans, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Special Needs Plans (HIV-SNPs), as\nwell as Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs)].\nNew York State (NYS) Medicaid members, including NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MMC, are eligible\nfor doula services during pregnancy and up to 12 months after the end of a pregnancy, regardless of the\npregnancy outcome. If a NYS Medicaid member becomes pregnant within the 12 months following a prior\npregnancy, their eligibility for doula services will start over with the new pregnancy and any unused perinatal\ndoula services from the prior pregnancy will not carry over.\nNYS Medicaid members, including NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MMC, will be eligible for coverage of\ndoula services under the NYS Medicaid doula services benefit regardless of the amount of doula services\nthey may have received through the NYS Medicaid Erie County Doula Service Pilot program. This article\nsupersedes all previously published articles, guidance and policies pertaining to doula services. The NYS\nMedicaid Erie County Doula Service Pilot program ended as of February 29, 2024, and this statewide doula\nservices benefit and the associated policy and billing guidance take the place of the coverage, policy, and\nbilling guidance provided under the program.\nDoula services are a preventative health service, and as such, must be recommended by a physician or other\nlicensed practitioner of the healing arts acting within their scope of practice under State law to be eligible for\nNYS Medicaid reimbursement. Licensed providers of perinatal and maternity care services are to discuss the\nbenefits of doula care with NYS Medicaid members, and as long as it is clinically appropriate, to provide all\nsuch MMC enrollees with a recommendation for doula services.\nPlease note: On June 10, 2024, the NYS Commissioner of Health (COH) issued a standing order, titled Non-\nPatient-Specific Standing Order for the Provision of Doula Services for Pregnant, Birthing and Postpartum\nPersons, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/doula/docs/2024-06_doula_\nstanding_order.pdf, which fulfills the federal requirements in §504.3, 440.130(c) of title 42 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations, located at: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-C/part-440/\nsubpart-A/section-440.130, for a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts acting within their\nscope of practice to provide a written order for preventive services. As such, on or after June 10, 2024, NYS\nMedicaid members who have a recommendation for doula services issued by a physician do not need an\nadditional recommendation for doula services to be eligible for coverage by NYS Medicaid.\nContinued on Page 3\n***************************************************************************************************************", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}

NYS Medicaid\nManaged Care (MMC) Plans must comply, at a minimum, with this coverage, effective December 1, 2024.\nHSTs, also known as Unattended Sleep Studies or Home Sleep Apnea Tests (HSAT), are intended to help\ndiagnose sleep disordered breathing conditions in the home-setting when medically appropriate. A sleep\ntechnologist or qualified healthcare professional is not physically present with the patient during the recording\nsession of an HST.\nNYS Medicaid FFS Coverage Criteria for HST\nNYS Medicaid FFS coverage for HST is limited to NYS Medicaid members who would experience difficulty\ntraveling to a sleep lab for a lab-based sleep test (polysomnography) due to mobility issues [e.g., NYS\nMedicaid members who need assistance with ambulation or use a Durable Medical Equipment (DME) to\nambulate, such as a wheelchair or a walker] as long as the HST is a medically appropriate alternative for the\nNYS Medicaid member.\nFor NYS members who meet the above coverage criteria, healthcare providers should use their clinical\njudgement to determine if a HST is a medically appropriate alternative to a lab-based sleep test\n(polysomnography). Additionally, HST raw data must be reviewed and interpreted by a Sleep Medicine\nspecialist who is either board-certified or board-eligible in Sleep Medicine.\nAge\nAdults 18 years of age and over who meet the NYS Medicaid FFS coverage criteria for HST are eligible for\nHST. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) does not recommend the use of HST for the\ndiagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in children because of insufficient evidence indicating its validity\nto identify OSA in children at this time.\nAugust 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "unknown"}

HST can only be used to diagnose sleep disordered breathing\nconditions, such as OSA, and cannot be used to diagnose other sleep disorders. HST results may sometimes\nbe inaccurate due to multiple factors relating to the inherent nature of home-based sleep testing and may\nsometimes underdiagnose the severity of OSA. It is imperative that health care providers use good clinical\njudgement when determining if a HST is a medically appropriate alternative to a lab-based sleep test\n(polysomnography).\nFrequency\nHST can only be billed once per year. If a repeat HST is needed before the one-year mark, persuasive medical\nevidence will be required. Repeat studies may be indicated for the following situations:\n1. If the first study was technically inadequate due to equipment failure.\n2. If the NYS Medicaid member did not know how to operate the HST equipment correctly or did not\nsleep for a sufficient amount of time to allow a clinical diagnosis.\nFor positive test results and prescribing of positive airway pressure equipment (PAP therapy), providers\nshould refer to the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Provider Procedure Code Manual – Physician Medicine,\nDrugs and Drug Administration Procedure Code, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/\nPhysician/PDFS/Physician_Procedure_Codes_Sect2.pdf.\nPatient Rights and Consent\nThe treating health care provider shall provide the member with information about HST and obtain consent\nfrom the patient.
