Compliance with the requirements of SOS §363-d is a condition\nof payment of the medical assistance program.\nAll providers who are subject to the mandatory compliance program requirements in SOS §363-d will\nbe impacted by these changes and should take the steps necessary to review the changes, then\ncomply.\nIt is the provider’s responsibility to ascertain whether or not they are required to implement and operate an\neffective compliance program under the statute [see SOS §363-d(4)]. Providers subject to the provisions of\nthis section include those for which the medical assistance program is a substantial portion of their business\noperations. “Substantial portion of business operations” is defined in 18 New York Consolidated Rules and\nRegulations (NYCRR) Part 521. The Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) will issue updated\nguidance in the coming months.\nOMIG monitors providers' adherence to the requirements found in SOS §363-d and Part 521. Providers are\nadvised to review the amendments made to SOS §363-d, in Part QQ of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2020 which\ncan be found at: https://omig.ny.gov/compliance/compliance-library. In the interim, providers subject to the\nmandatory compliance program requirements must continue to maintain and operate their compliance\nprograms.\nQuestions regarding the information presented in this article should be directed to OMIG’s Bureau of\nCompliance at (518) 408-0401 or via email at compliance@omig.ny.gov.\n****************************************************************************************************************", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}

The\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is dedicated to improving interoperability and patient\naccess to health information. The NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program is a part of the CMS Promoting\nInteroperability Program but will continue to operate under the current name of NY Medicaid EHR Incentive\nProgram.\nPayment Year (PY) 2020 Soft Opening Period\nAs the timeframes between payment years become shorter, providers who are ready to attest will be given\nthe opportunity to do so before the official payment year opening, by means of a process called a soft opening.\nThe soft opening will function in the same way an official opening does, with remediation and review\nprocesses that mirror what providers are used to. The main differences are that soft openings occur earlier in\nthe year, and because of this the Meaningful Use (MU) criteria must be met sooner than normal if a provider\nwishes to attest during this period.\nThe PY2020 Soft Opening period begins October 1, 2020. Beginning on this date, providers who have met\nthe attestation criteria will be able to complete their attestations in Medicaid EHR Incentive Program\nAdministrative Support Service (MEIPASS). Providers may login to the MEIPASS system at:\nhttps://meipass.emedny.org/ehr/login.xhtml. Providers are encouraged to gather and submit their attestation\ndata during this time. For additional information about the soft opening, a webinar will be held on Tuesday,\nSeptember 22, 2020, at 11 a.m. An open discussion will follow the webinar presentation. Providers may\nregister for this webinar at: https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/2168201054525209101.\nPayment Year (PY) 2020 Pre-Validation Period\nIf EPs or a group of EPs have already selected their reporting period and calculated their patient volume prior\nto the MEIPASS attestation system being opened for the payment year, the EPs are able to complete a Pre-\nValidation. A Pre-Validation allows providers to submit their patient volume data for review and approval\nahead of attestation and can allow the EPs to advance through the review process more quickly once\nMEIPASS begins accepting attestations.\nPre-Validations for PY 2020 will be accepted from September 14, 2020 through December 14, 2020. If\nproviders would like to take advantage of this service and avoid patient volume remediation during the official\nor soft opening attestation periods, they must begin the process of finding a suitable Medicaid patient volume\nreporting period.\nTo submit a Pre-Validation, simply select your Patient Volume Reporting period and fill out the appropriate\nPre-Validation form with the data for that period. These templates can be found in the Document Repository\nat: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/ehr/repository/index.htm.\n*Pre-Validations submitted before the official request period begins will not be considered. All submissions received before this time\nmust be re-submitted during the Pre-Validation Period for a review to occur.\nAugust 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
