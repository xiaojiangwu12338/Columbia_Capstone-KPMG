Additionally, Medicaid does not reimburse any supplies or procedures used to\ntreat SD/ED for persons required to register as sex offenders. Providers must verify that Medicaid members\nreceiving any procedures or supplies which may be used for these indications are not listed as registered sex\noffenders. There may be limited exceptions where some of these services are covered for members on the\nsex offender list, if their conditions are not related to SD/ED.

This financial assistance is being implemented as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)\nsigned into law on March 11, 2021, which can be found at: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-\ncongress/house-bill/1319/text.\nNearly 120,000 enrollees with income below 400 percent federal poverty level (FPL) are already receiving\nenhanced tax credits and nearly 18,000 higher-income enrollees are eligible for these federal tax credits for\nthe first time. Higher-income individuals enrolled outside of NY State of Health and uninsured individuals may\nalso be eligible for enhanced tax credits available through NY State of Health. Before the ARPA, tax credits\nwere not available to higher-income individuals and their families (i.e., those earning more than $51,040 and\nfamilies of four earning more than $104,800). Through the ARPA, these federal tax credits are available to\nthese individuals and their families when enrolling in a health plan through NY State of Health.\nIndividuals with low and moderate incomes (i.e., those earning up to $51,040 and families of four earning up\nto $104,800) who were previously eligible for tax credits are now eligible for higher tax credits. NY State of\nHealth automatically applied higher tax credits without enrollees needing to take any action. Enrollees can\nmake changes to their account by logging into their NY State of Health account, contacting an Enrollment\nAssistor, and/or calling NY State of Health at (855) 355-5777.\nTo allow as many individuals as possible to access these enhanced tax credits, the 2021 Open Enrollment\nPeriod has been extended through December 31, 2021. Individuals and families can apply for coverage\nthrough the NY State of Health website at: http://www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov, by phone at (855) 355-5777,\nor by connecting with a free enrollment assistor via the NY State of Health “Find a Broker/Navigator” search\ntool at: https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/agent/hx_brokerSearch?fromPage=INDIVIDUAL&lang=en.\nAdditional Information\nTo read more about how NY State of Health enrollees benefit from the ARPA, providers can visit the How NY\nState of Health Enrollees Benefit from the American Rescue Plan web page, found at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/americanrescueplan.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nSeptember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7", "chunk_type": "text", "category": "Medicaid Update"}
